As more people receive vaccine shots, covid-19 cases are occurring mostly in the increasingly narrow slice of the unprotected population. So The Washington Post adjusted its case, death and hospitalization rates to account for that - and found that in some places, the virus continues to rage among those who haven't received a shot. The rosy national figures showing declining case numbers led the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to loosen mask recommendations and President Biden to advise people to take off their masks and smile. But adjustments for vaccinations show the rate among susceptible, unvaccinated people is 69 percent higher than the standard figures being publicized. With that adjustment, the national death rate is roughly the same as it was two months ago and is barely inching down.",,,,,,gsars : Novel Coronaviruses | gout : Outbreaks/Epidemics | gimmu : Immunizations | gcat : Political/General News | gcold : Respiratory Tract Diseases | ghea : Health | gmed : Medical Conditions | gspox : Infectious Diseases | gtrea : Medical Treatments/Procedures,usa : United States | use : Northeast U.S. | uswa : Washington State | namz : North America | usw : Western U.S.,,Health-Environment-Science,Washington Post,Document WP00000020210530eh5u0001l

The problem: The only other kids in our neighborhood don't mask or social distance when they ask her to play. When I talked to their parents about Covid precautions, they looked at me like I had three heads and refused. Nothing is more important than our daughter's safety, but we care about her socialization too.

Rather than an early December weekend celebration with a three-hour Opera House performance as its centerpiece, the 43rd Honors will be filmed Tuesday through Saturday in multiple Kennedy Center spaces, including its stages, its roof and the Reach, an expansion that opened in 2019.",,,,,,gmusic : Music | gsars : Novel Coronaviruses | gout : Outbreaks/Epidemics | gcha : Charities/Philanthropy | gcat : Political/General News | gcold : Respiratory Tract Diseases | gcom : Society/Community | gent : Arts/Entertainment | ghea : Health | gmed : Medical Conditions | gspox : Infectious Diseases,usa : United States | namz : North America,,Style,Washington Post,Document WP00000020210516eh5g0002o
