Then we checked out from Hotel and started our drive to a very beautiful and famous Paragliding spot in Sarangkot, Pokhara. Here so many tourist come to paraglide , This spot is a mountain top and there is a smooth solves from the mountain top and very much fit for paragliding. The other  most special thing of that place is , From here The Himalayas can be viewed very clearly.  Caption: A paragliding spot at Sarangkot, Pokhara, Nepal. Here 2 Para Gliders were preparing their paragliding ride with the help of the guide (Expert)  from the mountain top. Photographer Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smart phone Samsung J7 Pro.   Ok, Now Let’s know shortly  about Paragliding :Paragliding, sport of flying parachutes with design modifications that enhance their gliding capabilities. It is one of the most thrilling, exciting and the recreational and competitive adventure sport of flying. Para gliders have no rigid framework; the parachute canopy acts as a wing and is constructed of fabric cells with openings at the front that allow them to be inflated by movement through the air—the “ram-air” effect. Caption: A paragliding spot at Sarangkot, Pokhara, Nepal. Here a Paraglider is flying from the Mountain top of that paragliding spot. Photographer Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smart phone Samsung J7 Pro.   The pilot is suspended in a seated harness and controls the wing via lines attached to the trailing edge of the paraglider. These lines may be operated individually to turn the paraglider or simultaneously to influence pitch and speed. Takeoff and landing are on foot and usually occur on a hill or mountain. To launch, the pilot first inflates the wing by pulling it up like a kite and then runs down the hillside until flying speed has been reached. Usually a speed of about 12 miles per hour (19 km per hour) is enough to launch the craft. Para gliders may also be launched from flatland by towing, either with a winch or behind a vehicle.  Caption: A paragliding spot at Sarangkot, Pokhara, Nepal. Here some Paragliders are flying from the Mountain top of that paragliding spot. That looked like 'birds' were flying ....Photographer Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smart phone Samsung J7 Pro.  Caption: Amination of some photos of me at the Paragliding spot at Sarangkot, Pokhara, Nepal.  Photographer Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smart phone Samsung J7 Pro.     Caption : A video made at the Paragliding spot at  Sarangkot, Pokhara, Nepal.  Photographer Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smart phone Samsung J7 Pro.   We stayed that Paragliding spot more than one hour and learn more about this flying, Also we took some photos of this place too! That time as we were new so did not flying, but next time I will surely ride that exciting paragliding! We learned much about the paragliding and it's riding methods.  Caption: A view of the Himalayas from Pokhara , Nepal. Photographer Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smart phone Samsung J7 Pro.   After then we started our drive to Pokhara, This is also an amazing place! Many tourist from various countries come here for travelling and enjoy their holidays too.  I will tell later that story (Visiting Pokhara) with 'Nepal Trip part-3 and part -4'.  I think @AdamGT  will like this post as he also visited Pokhara, Nepal too!😍😍  Today ends up here , 🖐😊 Pls. don't forget to comments here and also pls share your Himalayas or paragliding experiences here with photo if you have any!  Have a nice day to all my friends!!🌻🌻 MahbubWarm Greetings 🌹💗  from Chittagong cityBangladesh. 🇧🇩🇧🇩 Pls click here to see my recent posts!!

But I can share my previous visiting places with you guys! Today I will tell you a travel story in Nepal. I visited Nepal 2 times! And also love to visit again in future. Nepal is a country of different landscapes and most of the areas are surrounded bu Mountains and Hills. This country is a landlocked country and there is no sea beach or coastal areas in Nepal, They use Indian some ports to carry their goods, materials  for in and out. Although they don't have sea beaches , this country is enriched with so beautiful natural views.  Everybody knows about the Himalayas, My story today is about the Himalayas, and it is the post I mentioned - 'my Nepal visit- Part-1' gradually I will post Part -2 , Part-3.....Pls Keep up your eyes on my posts..... on the way to SarangkotCaption: A view of our road trip from Kathmandu to Sarangkot, Pokhara, Nepal.

Photographer @MAHBUB_HYDER , Device : Samsung J7pro What is Ocean and Sea? Ocean is not a huge body of blue water or strong waves hit on the shore and beaches. It is also a part of our life, our poetry, romanticness, philosophical views ....   at Cox's bazarCaption: A photo of myself! Photo Captured from World's Largest sea Beach at Inani, Cox Bazar, Bangladesh. Device : Nikon D3200 It’s not always easy to find the right words to articulate the vastness and might of the ocean. Luckily, many of the world’s most renowned authors, poets, scientists, and philosophers have developed a deep affection for the ocean during their lifetimes. As such, they have found marvelous words to describe the beauty of the ocean and sea and its waves too!.  Bali , IndonesiaCaption: A photo of myself! Looking forward to see the vastness of the ocean, Photo captured from Uluwatu sea beach Bali, Indonesia by my Device : Samsumsung J7 pro, help to take this pic by my companion!  I love the vastness of the ocean too much. I also love its serenity, tranquility, humility, and purifying power…~ When I Stand at the beach looking at the angry and wild ocean currents moving toward me, I feel life – ever-changing!, aggressive!!, persistent!!!, yet silent.!!!!  Caption: Photo Captured from Bali, Indonesia. Photographer @MAHBUB_HYDER , Device : Samsung J7pro   ~ There are many similarity with our life and ocean. ~ Life also doesn’t stop moving like the ocean. We must carry on with it.~ Sometimes, it simply wants us to let go of our beliefs. And other times it wants us to start over again.  Phukhel, ThailandCaption: Photo Captured from Phuket, Thailand.

This is really important us and for our future generation to save the Ocean and the fauna of the sea and ocean! You may know that the ocean covers almost 71% of the surface of the whole earth. Also This day reminds us of the major role the oceans have in everyday of our life. They are the lungs of our Planet and a great source of foods and medicines and a critical part of the biosphere. Everyday Thousands Metric tons of fishes and sea foods are collected from sea and ocean all over the world! But Now a days Many made abstract, garbage, plastic bottles, cans and different types of poly bags and polythene go the sea and ocean mix with water and also those things make a cover on the sea ground surfaces! That is so much alarming for our sea and ocean and fishes. This is high time we should take care specially about pollutions of ocean. We need to keep pollution free ocean for our next generation. Caption: Photo Captured from Padang Padang beach in Bali, Indonesia .

Photographer - Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by Samsung A50  Staying at Home for long time due to Covid pandemic situation makes all my members so crazy and bored. Every body need to breathe in a clean, lively green and wide nature. So, we decide to go at sea beach that is closed to my house.   2nd day of EID (15th May 2021) we hangout for a mini picnic cum visiting sea beach with whole my family. From our area (Akbar Shah Railway Housing ) to the nearest Sea Beech, namely - ‘Dakshin Kattali Sea Beach’ /‘দক্ষিণ কাট্টলী সমুদ্র সৈকত’  which is about 7~8 kilometers from my house, we hired a CNG Auto to reach there. And we paid Tk. 200 for this trip ($2.5). Caption: A selfie of myself along with my full family was about to start to the sea beach in afternoon on the 2nd day of ""EID""Photographer- Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER  Caption: A view of sea beach with some boats and people, visited this sea beach, Photo captured by Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , Device: Samsung J7 pro  Caption: An evening view of the sea beach, Photo captured by Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , Device: Samsung J7 pro  Caption: A boat view in the sea beach,  photographer - @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my camera: Nikon D3200    Caption: Trees view in the sea beach,  photographer - @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my camera: Nikon D3200    Caption: Some landscapes trees view in the sea beach,  photographer - @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my camera: Nikon D3200  Caption: some landscapes and trees view in the sea beach,  photographer - @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my camera: Nikon D3200  Let’s know in brief about -   ‘Dakshin Kattali Sea Beach’ /‘দক্ষিণ কাট্টলী সমুদ্র সৈকত’ In Chittagong city,  if go to the south side through the Chittagong Coastal Road, you can see only sea and sea beaches of different landscapes, there are so many spots have to visit sea beaches in Chittagong city , but 8-10 are very famous!  And people of Chittagong city even from other districts visit and enjoy their afternoon and evening those spots.  ‘Dakshin Kattali Sea Beach’ /‘দক্ষিণ কাট্টলী সমুদ্র সৈকত’  is one of them. In the Google maps this place is showing as duplicate names, other name of the sea beach in the Google Maps is South Kattali Sea Beach , Both are places are in same area but created two places! This sea beach also very known as  Jele para Sea beach too. (জেলেপাড়া সমুদ্র সৈকত), ‘Jele para’ means fishermen place, as many fishermen reside and anchor their boats at this place , this place name become “Jele para Sea beach” too. (জেলেপাড়া সমুদ্র সৈকত),  Caption: My family members are walking around the beach area, photographer- Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER  First impression of entering into this place, you can see many of colorful fishing boats are scattered this area. Then if you enter some inside then you can see plenty of green trees, grassy field, muddy surfaces, and even some sandy surfaces around this place. A very nice and cool environment in that place. No doubt a wonderful place for any nature lover, One side many of Fishing boats, other side so many green trees, and sea beaches views as well as different types of Landscape views are also fantastic. In the evening time and sunset time the views become so attractive and marvelous. Where it is located ad how to reach there:It is located at South Kattali area, Pahartali, Chittagong, It is very close to Chittagong Coastal Road (Toll Road) at South Kattali point.  From Chittagong city anyone can easily come here through Chittagong Coastal Road (Toll Road) in reach the South Kattali point. If anyone come from inside the Pahartali area he can follow first the ‘Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium (it's maps link here)' at Sagorika, beside that stadium there is a road connected to the Beach area through the Coastal (toll) road. You can use CNG Auto taxi, Private car, Microbuses to reach there, Public buses are not available at the place. Famous places nearby this Sea beach:Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium (maps link)Halishahar beachShuktara Chinese Restaurant and parkKattali beachCoastal Mermaid Restaurant & Lounge We reached at the Sea beach in the afternoon around 04.30pm and first we pitched a tent in the beach area on an open grassy field. As this place have no house or seating place, then we move around and enjoy the beauty of this area, we took many photos of this area, I also contribute in google Maps adding some photos! Then we cooked simple Noodles with egg and vegetables. (We collected those from our house and only cooked there. Caption: A photo of our camping site in the sea beach area, photographer Local Guide - @MAHBUB_HYDER, By may camera: Nikon D3200  Caption: A college of photos of our camping site in the sea beach area, photographer Local Guide - @MAHBUB_HYDER, By may camera: Nikon D3200     Caption: A photo of our camping site in the sea beach area, my office staff was preparing  vegetable egg noodles for us..photographer Local Guide - @MAHBUB_HYDER  , device: Nikon D3200   After then we ate together in front of our camping site with so relaxing mood.

After completing one month long fasting we start eating and other general activities same as before! After finishing fasting – first day is the main festival day, but the image and cheers of the EID festival remains after 2/3 days too.  In many Muslim country EID festival holidays provides a long days, it may be minimum 3 days to maximum 7 days long. (it depends on country, situation and others ), we follow Arabic calendar to count fasting period and EID day too! Fasting continue full months of “Ramadan”( Arabic month) and EID day counts as the 1st day of “Showal” (Arabic Month) Caption: Last evening (after sunset)1st moon of Shawal captured by my Smartphone Samsung A50, Photographer , Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , we eagerly waiting for this moon !

I remember in my boyhood we start dancing and shouting with cheering voices among with our relatives and neighbors' children, after see the 1st Moon of Showal! Means the next day will be our EID day! It is an untold feelings inside out minds!  Caption: A selfie of myself along with my son (viewed at my left side with wearing a black Panjabi.

Come to point now – I will tell my story of EID day today, I will tell you my activities of this festival day. How I celebrate my EID day. From the morning it was a cloudy day! I went to the Akbarshah Railway Housing Jame Mosjid(a mosque nereby my house), nearby my house along with my Son to pray our EID special prayers with taking all possible safety measures (also maintaining full social distances) and personal protections! (EID special ""Salat"" / Prayer generally holds in the morning around from 7.00am to 10.00am).  After complete our EID prayers at 08.45am, I back to home and eat some special foods that cooked and arranged by my wife! She is a very good cook, and she knows how to prepare many delicious dishes, Today she cooked and arranged some sweet items Like “Shemai”, “Jorda”, “Faluda”, “fruits custard”  and Biryani and also some  meat items along with salad! We eat every items little along with  my full family members. After I give some foods to my house securities (as they are poor). Also send some foods to our neighbors’ houses!  Caption : Some of food dishes prepared by my wife at my house and served at our house dining table for EID day celebration,  Photographer @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smartphone Samsung A50.  Caption : Some of food dishes prepared by my wife at my house and served at our house dining table for EID day celebration,  Photographer @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smartphone Samsung A50.   After then about 10.00 am it starts a heavy rain at my area, I am fully stuck at home.As Covid -19 pandemic situation is bad here and also our Govt. declared Lockdown (it continued almost 2 months). We could not move freely and could join with other friends and relatives. Full day just stay in my house. As it was rain in the morning so it also stuck us more for outing too. 2/3 hours I just enjoyed the nature of rain from my house windows and balcony. It felt nice and hear the beautiful rhythm of rain sounds, and I felt down a deep romantic and poetic moments /impressions and enjoyed a lot of rainy nature. Pls see the beow photos to enjoy a rainy nature at my place!: Caption : A rainy nature captured from my house window today at EID day , Photographer  Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smartphone Samsung A50.    Caption : A rainy nature captured from my house window today at EID day , Photographer  Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smartphone Samsung A50.   Caption : A rainy nature captured from my house window today at EID day , Photographer  Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smartphone Samsung A50.  Caption : A couple of photos of a rainy nature captured from my house window and balcony today at EID day , Photographer  Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smartphone Samsung A50.    Caption : A couple of photos of a rainy nature captured from my house window and balcony today at EID day , Photographer  Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , captured by my smartphone Samsung A50.    Do you have any experiences to enjoy a rainy day for a few hours?

Duration of capture - Last year while I travelled there.  If you are a nature lover and walk in the morning at sand beach or Sea shore, these flowers must attract you!,  and your mind obviously become cool and happy for a while!, It seems to be smiling with you from a sand beach, While you are walking in a sandy sea beech or sea shore specially in the morning – Imagine, ~ “The sounds of waves coming from horizon hitting at the sea shore or sand beach, makes our mind’s with wonder and charm!” At the same time if you notice those flowers besides you!, which are smiling and creeping up with you! How do feel dear!? Express your opinion seeing my photos……!  Anyway,  It’s a so beautiful creeping plant (a kind of wild vine grows in the sandy and salty shore/beach) having with so attractive flowers! Have you ever heard about this flowers and do you know the flowers and creeping plants name? Pls.  let us know! What is the name of this plant and flower?:There is no appropriate Bengali name here in Bangladesh, but it looks like our very common “Kolmi” Flower (কলমি ফুল) so Its name in our country is Sagor Kolmi (সাগর কলমি). In bengali language  “Sagor” means “sea”, It generally live/grows in the sea shore or sea beach so, Its name is “Sagor kolmi” (সাগর কলমি), It has other popular name, is Sagor lota (সাগর লতা) in English it can be translated as “Sea creeping”. It’s a creeping plants grows in the sea shore so its name also “Sagor lota (সাগর লতা)” The appearance of this leaf is the shape of the ‘goat's foot hoof’, so the other name of this creeping plant is “Goatkhur (ছাগল খুর).In English language it is generally knowns as  “Beach Morning Glory” or “Coastal morning glory”, It is also known as “Goat’s foot creeper”,  “Bay hops” etc..In Hindi (Indian) is called as “Do Patti Lata”What is the name of this flowers in your country dear??? Let’s know in brief about this flower and the plant of “Sagor Lota”/ “Sagor Kolmi”- or ” Beach Morning Glory  Scientific name: ‘Ipomoea pes-caprae’Family: ‘Convolvulaceae’Higher Classification: “False bindweeds’Order: ‘Solanales’Rank: “Species’You may see the below YouTube video (link provided) for more about this flower and creeping plant:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TbhumpLNICA Taking photo of Sagor lataCaption: I am here capturing the photo of ""Sagor Lata/Kolmi Lota"" i.e. ""Beach Morning Glory"" in a morning last year with my smartphone Samsung A50, with a LG logo on the back cover, Photographer one of companion used my Smartphone ""Samsung J7pro"" Photo captured from Inani Sea Beach, Cox's Bazar, Bangladesh.   These plants can survive well in salty water and just on the pure sandy surfaces like sea shore, sand beach etc, this creeper has spread to many countries in the world by sea. As the seeds of this creeping plant are so tolerant of salt water and float in water   “Sagarkalami/ Sagor lata” or Beach Morning glory is one of the plants in which the ocean spread has occurred. It is generally seen at off the coast of the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian Ocean, New South Wales, Queensland Coast, Hawaii Island, Mexico, Africa, Florida. In Bangladesh we have long sea and sand beach, namely “Cox’s Bazar” , that is almost 120 km long, so Cox’s Bazar sea beach is called as “World’s largest sea beach” So most of our coastal areas in Cox’s bazar it easy can be found, Beside that Kuakata and St. Islands is can be seen easily.  The leaves of these kind of creeping plant are bright green, its leaves look like (appearance) Goat’s hoof. Its fruits and flowers are big and looks like a mike, Flowers bloom almost all the yearlong. Kalmi is very well known in Bengali language. Those flowers (Sagor lota) are very similar to the flowers, fruits and character of Kalmi. It is a thin herbaceous perennial herb. The width of the vine is 2 cm or less. Sequence 6.4 mm. The team is about 40 mm long. The fruit is brown in color and it contains four seeds. The seeds are black in color. Caption: A brunch of ""Sagor Lata/Kolmi Lota"" i.e. ""Beach Morning Glory"" ~ creeping plans are seen at the sand beach of Inani, Photographer - Local Guide @MAHBUB_HYDER , by my smartphone Samsung A50. Duration of capture - Last year while I travelled there.   The blue water and waves from the sea is now flowing freely on the shores of the sea. ‘Sagar Lata’ has lost its existence in the face of various man-made architectures, adversities and artificial installation in the shore are for tourism and other purposes. As the crowds in Cox's Bazar have decreased due to the corona virus, a fair of 'Sagar Lata' has started to be held on Cox's Bazar and other sea beaches in Bangladesh! It’s a very cool scene now! We should protect our earth, and these creeping plats too, for its normal breeding out! Our 'Slogan' always should be   “Save the earth! And save our planet!” You may be boring with long writing of me , so here I am ending up today! Have a great day my all loving LGs!🌻🌻 Take care all my friends! Be safe, healthy and happy as well as  smilingly always ! 🙏💜 MahbubWarm Greeting 🌹 from Chittagong city,Bangladesh.🇧🇩

323475,"Sharbats, Fresh fruits juices, and juicy fruits ~ I strongly recommend for Iftar (fast breaking) _ P",136,94.0,"
Hi LGs👋 Greetings for Holy Ramadan!💚💛🧡🌺🎉 You may know that one month Holy Ramadan is going on and most of the Muslim people are celebrating this holy Ramadan as a religious matter very sincerely and happily! Caption: Gifs of my some favorite drinks photos.   photos captured by @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my smart phone Samsung A50 Caption: One of my favorite juice ..Its a lemon juice with some sugar and put those in a glass of cold water ..some lemon slices floating onnthe top of glass, its a one of the best menu on my Iftar table, photo captured by @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my smart phone Samsung A50 Caption: My favorite watermelon fresh juice with some lemon slices on my Iftar table, photo captured by @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my smart phone Samsung A50 Caption: A simple Iftar recipe of me, Mango Juice, cornflakes with milk, and salad , photo captured by @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my smartphone Samsung A50 Caption: An Iftar foods items on my house dining table , Lemon Juices, various fresh fruits slices, Bananas, ""Chona"" , ""Peyaju"", ""Beguni"" Chira with milk and coconut(Chira is made of rice), fruits custard, Cucumber slices..etc..., photo captured by @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my smartphone Samsung A50 What is Ramadan and fasting:Actually Ramadan is the very special month for Muslim, It continue one month and after completion of fasting, we celebrate, The “Eid –Ul- Fitr” or “Eid festival”, ~ the biggest festival for Muslim people! And this day is celebrated by almost whole world as a special national Holiday!Ramadan means not only just fasting (without having foods, drinks and sex) it is great month of ""Peach"". Moreover Ramadan month is a training period  for all Muslims 'for rectify ourselves!', it teaches us how to control ourselves as good man, how control our attitude, eating habits, behavior with other people, develop sacrifice mind, life styles and others human characters, develop prayers mind …,,, in a word a Ramadan helps us to be a “real pure man”! Muslims are trained by this holy months and continue their activities whole the yearlong as per training. Caption: Collage of some photos of fruits that generally I like eay at Iftar, Photographer @MAHBUB_HYDER Anyway today my main intention to let you know what kind of foods I prefer at Iftar (fast breaking time). Fast breaking time is known by the Muslim in the world as “IFTAR”, It is very hoy time and important time for all Muslim, This also a very good time for prayer and Allah (our creator) loves that time prayer too much (prayer just few minutes before Iftar)Caption: An Iftar foods items on my house dining table , cold Lemon Juices, various fresh juicy fruits slices (Water lemon, papayas, pine apples, apples, local fruit ""Bangi""..etc... ) beside those fruits custard and dates are also placed there.., photo captured by @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my smartphone Samsung A50 In our country we live in the tropical region, and maximum time in a year here is hot weather! And Ramadan is in this year at full summer period. We finish our last eating in the very early morning (about 04.00am) and we break our fasting about 06.20pm. As here we have to fast more than 14 hours, we become rehydrate and  our body needs much water at ifter (fast breaking time), So I recommend for my Iftar liquid food much than other spicy and oily food! Actually Iftar is very special for all Muslim people, they always try to make delicious and some special foods at that time eat together with whole family, sometimes with neighbors, sometimes with friend and relatives and sometimes with office colleagues, Now a days Covid -19 pandemic situation is serious so we mostly take ifter with our family only. Although there are so many items have in the Iftar, but I strongly recommend you to all to eat some Sherbets, Fresh fruits juice (fruits make sliced and blended in the house), fresh cow milk, and other some healthy beverages. In here now Lemons, water melons, papayas, mangos and pineapples are available. These kinds of fruits juice can be the best drinks for Iftar.  Besides that some Juicy fruits also will be the great foods for  Iftar, Like Dates, bananas, pine apples, papayas, guavas, apples , Maltas, mangoes ets .. Now all the above mentioned fruits are  available in our country.  Caption: Collage of some photos of drinks,  fruits  and other foods that generally I like to eat at Iftar,  photos are taken from my house dining table, photographer: @MAHBUB_HYDER   In my house everyday I break my fasting (at Iftar) with ""Dates"" ( as it is our Sunnah, i.e. our prophet Hazrat Muhammad (SM) always beark fasting with dates, then i go (2nd choice) for Sharbat /special drinks (a very special Sherbat namely “Rooh Afza”. Rooh Afza is famous in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. Now a days it also popular at some Arab countries. It is a healthy syrups that can make a healthy drinks too! Caption: 2 sizes of bottles of ""Sherbat E Rooh Afza"" can be found in the shops and markets! photo captured by @MAHBUB_HYDER  by my smart phone Samsung A50 Lets know in brief about ""Sharbat- E - Rooh Afza"" : It is one kind Herbal Syrups (beverage/drinks)  made of some fruits, vegetables, roots and flowers. The producer of this syrup name is Hamdard (Waqf) Laboratories Company. It was first made in 1906 AD, in India.

Again Let's come to the point.-  I prefer always liquid food in Iftar, Along with Roof Afza Sharbat I also prefer fresh ""juicy fruits juices"" , mainly papaya, watermelon, pine apple , mangos, sometimes others depends on availability…Besides that I always eat bananas, apples, maltas,guavas and some other local fruits as per availability. I love eat curds, it is so healthy too. Although I want to avoid spicy and oiy food like  “Chona  ” , “Beguni” , “Peyaju” , “Alu chop” but as a traditional food I have eat a little bit at times. At Iftar some sweet foods are also popular like “Chira”,  “Payesh”, “ Curd” ice cream. Sometimes we eat bread with beef or chicken curry too, Even sometimes we eat  some rich food like Polao, Khichuri, Biryani etc at Iftar… Now your turn, Pls share your Iftar preferences here to let us know …. Happy Ramadan Mubarak and advance Eid Mubarak to all ! It's Iftar Time for me now so need to be ended up  go to my Iftar table at my sweet home 😍  !!  Peace be upon you to all my beloved LGs!🙏🕊 Have a great day!! 🌻🌻🙏  MahbubWarm 🌹🌹greetings from Chittagong city, Bangladesh. 🇧🇩🇧🇩💚

It mostly cultivate in India, Bangladesh, and other South East Asian countries, Mexico, Central America and some other countries. It can be found all the yearlong. But In Bangladesh It grows mostly in the summer and rainy season.Guava’s scientific name is ‘Psidium guajava’, it has many local names in many regions. In Bangladesh it called Mostly “Peyara” some place it is called as “Goachi”. Mostly It looks Green color but after ripen it becomes light yellow- green. But Guava has different colors also, Radish colored guavas as also available in Bangladesh! Red guava is also known as ‘Red Apple’. Guava plants are not so big, It can grows 2 meter to 10 meters long, but now a day small sized guava trees are available and it can easily grows in the roof garden even a jar or drum. I also planted it at my house roof garden in a drum.  Caption: I planted a guava tree in a plastic drum at my House roof garden 😍photographer @MAHBUB_HYDER, Device : My smart phone - Samsung A50.    Befit and nutrition of Guava:Guava is one the best healthy, enriched with full of nutritious what is worldwide trusted!It contains Vitamin A, Vitamin-c, Calcium, Sodium, Iron and many other minerals, Eating guava  regularly helps you get more antioxidants that may help slow down the aging of your skin, It may boost up your immunity, help keep your heart good and healthy, control the blood sugar level. It may benefit at your digestive system. Guava are a weight loss friendly fruit too. Also there are so many benefits eating guavas regularly.  Although it seems to be a Food article but I considered it mainly in photography to make you smile and pleasant!   My Guava tree I planted almost two years ago in a drum at my House roof garden (at 8th floor). Now it fully grown up! Views of Guava plant, leaf , flowers and tender guavas, and ripen guavas are so enchanting and refreshing and eye catching. Sometimes I looks at my guava trees and feel so happy and pleasant in mind….  Caption: A guava is hanging on from my guava tree that I planted in a plastic drum at my House roof garden, photographer @MAHBUB_HYDER, Device : My smart phone - Samsung A50 When I have much quantity of Guavas I offered some to my Neighbors to eat!

Hello my dear all LGs!Warm greetings from Chittagong city, Bangladesh ⚘💙🤗🤝 ""Smoking is very harmful for health!☠"" I think almost all people all over the world know this more or less !! But still millions of people in world smoke! Not only now a days matter! It started from a very ancient time !! Although it is a bad habit you can't  avoid it at all!!It's an essential part of .....History...Culture...Civilisation...Art...Human life...so and so........??I also smoked earlier but from March 2020 I have stopped smoking when the Covid  19 Situation started from our country!!! It needs just a strong mental determination to stop it and I already overcomed ???!!! But my main story is not about smoking! My story is a specail smoking culture of Tribal people who live in Chittagong Hill Track.Chagrachari, Rangamati and Bandabans Hills Districts are in Chittagong Hill Track and Soth Side of Bangladesh is under Chittagong Hill Tracks. Edge of Khagrachari and Rangamati Hills district touch the Indin Borders and Bandarbans Hills District touch Myanmar Borders. Well, Now I'll tell about the ""special smoking by using a piece of bamboo"". This is very favourite in all Chittagong Hill Tracks. Many smokers of those area use a big bamboo for smoking, It's Local Name in Begali is ""HUKKA"" and tribal people call ""DABA"" ""What is the name of ""DABA"" at your area my Dear LGs??""Actually this kind of smoking is ""less harmful"" than general Cigarettes and other smokings as much water put in the bamboo and tobacco smoke comes through the water with nice filtering then goes to mouth and lungs.  How to make ""DABA"" you need a bamboo piece abou 3 to 4 feet long then make a hole in the middle of that bamboo. Then put a small pipe also made of bamboo branches and need one edge put inside the Bamboo and other edge keep at outside with a small plate with hole in the middle, then first put some tobacco paste then put some  burned coils on it...then it is ready for smoking!! Very interesting!!??? Isn't it?? Pls see the all photos I posted here:Caption: This photo taken from Rangamati district at my one tribal friend house. Photographer @MAHBUB_HYDER Google Maps link:https://maps.app.goo.gl/3Si9G4MUGNWGKKoM9  Caption: This photo taken from Rangamati district at my one tribal friend house. Photographer @MAHBUB_HYDER Google Maps link:https://maps.app.goo.gl/3Si9G4MUGNWGKKoM9   Caption: This photo taken from Panchari, Khagrachari district in front  my one tribal friend house.Photographer by LG @Subodh_chakma Google Maps link:https://maps.app.goo.gl/UjchxWFNjuW5W5XA9  Caption: This photo taken from Logang, Khagrachari District at a local tea shopPhotographer @MAHBUB_HYDER Google Maps Link:https://maps.app.goo.gl/3cp2vnYNu7pQWiAk8Caption: A selfie of myself with smoking cigarettes at Chennai sea beach in India.

323475,Travelling⛵by boat on a Rainy day 🌦 to Kaptai Lake🏞!!,207,182.0,"
Hi LGs ?How are you feiends?? Greetings from Chittagong, Bangladesh⚘⚘?? Now here in my country is full rainy season, almost all the day night it rains!! Sometimes it drizzling, sometimes it rain heavily and some times it becomes so cloudy!! And sunshine can be seen very rarely now a days! Do you like the sound of rain? But sometimes I love hear the romantic and beautiful rhythmic sounds of rain and see the nature of rain droppings!! Even sometimes I love to wet myself in the rain water !! It is very fantastic to me making fun in the rain!! Do you have any experience of Rain Bath? Today  I am telling an very interesting travel story by boat in a Rainy day in Kaptai lake and also some experience about wetting in the rain??And do think a travelling by boat in a rainy day ?  Generally people chose a day to travel in a sunny bright day! But I made a journey by boat at a beautiful lake that is ""Kaptai lake"". Today I am telling an very interesting travel story by boat in a Rainy day in Kaptai lake. We started in early morning in a rainy day by a vehicles namely Microbus.    A short  Description of Kaptai Lake:Google Maps link:Kaptai Lakehttps://maps.app.goo.gl/4SCJDme4oy1rPXKq8Do know about Kaptai lake? This is the largest and one of the most beautiful lake in Bangladesh, even it is one the largest lake in the world! And it is one the best Tourist attractions in Chittagong Hill Track as well as in Bangladesh. This lake is located at Rangamati District in Chittagong Hill Track, And Rangamati is the largest district of Bangladesh. Actually this lake is artificially created in 1960 by making dam across the Karnaphuli River at Kaptai main town area, and that dam is well known as ""Kaptai Dam""  that is a part of Karnaphuli Hydro Electric projects and this project provides us a huge quantity of electricity for the country Anyway the beauty of Kaptai lake is beyond description and so amazing. The wide lake is moving zigzag through the many small and big hills and mountains and green nature. Whole the lake dotted with many small islands of plain and hilly surfaces that makes the lakes view more charming. Many kinds of boats such as fishing, public transportation and tourists are moving in the lake all the day long. We, some of LGs and friends hired a tourist boat for our boat travelling. When we got in the boat a heavy rain started and we went the roof of the boat and took a fantastic rain bath! Do you imagine how fun we made on that time?!!??? pls see the below pictures???   Caption:  A dramatic and fascinating views of Rian bath in the boat at Kaptai Lake! This is a gif of a couple of photos taken by me and my friends by using my Smartphone Samsung J7PRO Caption: We started in the morning by a van we called Microbus to Kaptai lake from Chittagong city, Bangladesh in a rainy day!Photo captured by @MAHBUBHYDER  by my smartphone Samsung J7PRO , Here it is at Assam Bosti in Rangamati Lake areaMap link: https://maps.app.goo.gl/fJ4KsLN7TA6fp6xD9 Caption:  A fantastic view of Rian bath of myself in the boat at Kaptai Lake!

It is about 300 km from Dhaka coty to reach the Kaptai lake. It is also be noted that Kaptai lake is so big and wide that you can reach there from Rangamati or Kaptai town point. But Maximum tourists are love to come this via Rangamati town, After get down from the bus you can go the lake from various points such as Parjaton Bridge point, bonorura point , college gate point, Reserve Bazar point and also have other some small points, many people like to the from Porjaton Bridge point as it is best tourist point in Rangamati district. If you start from Chittagong you can go by public buses from Oxizen Bus terminal or even you can rent a car or micro bus or even your own vehicles, Several times I visited there by my motorcycle from Chittagong city.  From Chittagong city it is abou 65 km at Rangamati point and about 45 km to Kaptai point. That means from Chittagong city also you can go both way to reach there.We had our lunch in the boat that we arranged earlier to get in the boat. After a day long boat riding we returned to Chittagong city in the evening. That was so memorable travelling by boat at Kaptai lake. If you still don't go there pls try to make a ride by boat at Kaptai lake, you will be so pleased an happy  if you are a nature lover!😍🤩@Moestika

Here sun shine is peeping from the tree inside  Moreover,  so many furniture also made of old jack tree. Jackfruit is commonly used in South and Southeast Asian cuisines. Both ripe and unripe fruits are consumed. The jackfruit is the national fruit of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and the state fruit of the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It is available internationally canned or frozen and in chilled meals as are various products derived from the fruit such as noodles and chips. Ripe jackfruit is naturally sweet, with subtle pineapple- or banana-like flavoring. It can be used to make a variety of dishes, including custards, cakes, or mixed with shaved ice. It is very tasty to eat. And Jackfruit has a distinctive sweet and fruity aroma. Westerners generally will find the jackfruit most acceptable in the full-grown but unripe stage, when it has no objectionable odor, it can be cooked as a delicious vegetable dish. The fruit at this time is simply cut into large chunks for cooking, and cooked with various spices as like as other vegetables which is also very tasty to eat. Moreover, The seeds from ripe fruits are edible, and are said to have a milky, sweet taste often compared to Brazil nuts. They may be boiled, baked, or roasted. When roasted, the flavor of the seeds is comparable to chestnuts. Seeds are used as snacks (either by boiling or fire-roasting) or to make desserts.The seeds also have very high starch content, the Tree’s nutritional value rests in its seeds as Jackfruit seeds are extremely high in Vitamin B1 and Vitamin B2. The seeds also have very high starch content, but are quite low in the presence of iron and calcium. Each fruit can contain between 100 to 500 seeds, which are oily to the touch. The seeds are often preserved for later use and are often prepared in a mixture of brine, oil and syrup. But it may be little harmful for certain people who are allergic to it, especially those who are allergic to birch pollen ( 22 ). Moreover, due to its potential to lower blood sugar levels, individuals with diabetes may need to have their medication dosages changed if they eat this fruit on a regular basis. So, it is an amazing fruit which is consumed as delicious food in every stage of it’s life.  This is my story!!😅😍🤩🤩🤩!Now pls tell some story regarding or related with Jack fruits from your side!!  Thank you all !!🙏🙏🤝🤝 Have a beautiful day⚘⚘💚💚💙💙 Mahbub.

323475,Black tea with lemon and herbals may be the best drink for us,224,159.0,"
I love black tea very much😍, in the morning after a breakfast without a cup of black tea I can't believe a day. Generally minimum 2 times a day I take Black tea with some herbal and green leaves which have much antioxidants and medicated quality and objects.Caption: a cup of black tea with lemon and and some herbals. Photo captured by @MAHBUB_HYDER  on this morning by my smart phone Samsung A50. It is my favourite black lemon tea with harbal and leaves.  Black tea is one of the most consumed beverages in the world. Everyone should take minimum a cup of black tea in a a day!😊It comes from the Camellia sinensis plant and is often blended with other plants for different flavors, such as Earl Grey, English breakfast or 'chai'.It’s stronger in flavor and conta ins more caffeine than other teas, but less caffeine than coffee.Black tea also offers a variety of health benefits because it contains antioxidants and compounds that can help reduce inflammation in the body.Here are some health benefits of black tea:Has Antioxidant Properties. ...May Boost Heart Health. ...May Lower “Bad” LDL Cholesterol. ...May Improve Gut Health. ...May Help Reduce Blood Pressure. ...May Help Reduce the Risk of Stroke. ...May Lower Blood Sugar Levels. ...May Help Reduce the Risk of Cancer...And so on...The polyphenol antioxidants known as theaflavins are present in black tea that provides great protection to the body against several health hazards such as kidney stones, artery hardening, heart attacks and Parkinson's disease.You can add some lemon juice to it as Adding lemon to black tea boosts these theaflavins and helps them to stay longer.Moreover, you can give this tea a herbal flavour by adding someChamomileGarlic,Ginger,Clove,cardamon,Cinnamon,Holi basil,Mint,Bay leafBlack cumin, etc.  Caption: Tulshi leaves, captured from my house roof garden by my smartphone Samsung A50. English name: Holi Basil, Bangali name: তুলশী পাতা, Scientific name: Ocimum Sanctum Caption : Lemon tree with lemon, captured from my garden this morning  by Samsung A50  Caption : Cut Lemon slices prepared for put into black tea, captured from my garden this morning  by Samsung A50  Caption: A cup of black tea with lemon and herbals      Caption: some spices and herbals .English name: Clove, Bengali name: লবংগ, Scientefic name: Syzygium Aromaticum English name: Cardamom, Bengali name: এলাচ, Scientific name: Elettria Cardamomum.English name: Cinamon, Bengali name: দারুচিনি, Scientific name: Cinamomum ZeylanicumEnglish name: Bay leaf, Bengali name: তেজ পাতা, Scientific name: Cinamomum Tamala   Caption: Lemon and ginger and slices   Caption: Lemon and ginger and slices English name: Lemon, Bengali name: লেবু,  Scientific name: Citrus LimonEnglish name: Ginger, Bengali name: আদা,  Scientific name: Zingiber officinale.  The antioxidants and vitamins found in herbal teas are great for helping fight disease and infections, protect against oxidative stress, and lower the risk of chronic disease. Some of the best immune-boosting herbal teas are elderberry, echinacea, ginger, and liquorice root tea. Besides, This process makes your drink high in valuable protein, minerals, and active ingredients, the things your body needs, but also the things that bacteria like to thrive in. Your herbal tea should be made fresh daily. For enhancing the taste you can add some honey which  also contains powerful antioxidants which may negate some of the adverse effects caused by the sugar.COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, has already infected more than 3.4 million people globally and its rampant spread has forced virtually the entire world into a lockdown.The absence of a vaccine or a specific treatment for the disease means that the pandemic remains a major health risk for a significant portion of the global population.So far, treating the symptoms of an infected person has been the only viable recourse against the disease.Considering these factors, your body's natural defences may be your only reliable shield against the virus. Strengthening your immune system is therefore vital and physicians recommend doing so by incorporating nutrients packed with proteins, vitamins and minerals into your diet,Traditional herbal remedies may also help enhance your immunity and contain the symptoms of COVID-19, according to the Alternative Medical Care Department of the Directorate General of Health Services.So, it is also a hope for us that we can enhance our immune system by keeping this black tea associated with herbs and honey in our daily beverages that may gives us strength to fight against the virus although there is no proper treatment still invented for it. However, we are hoping for the best and may our world will soon see the end of the crisis!caption: all the items in a one photo for Black lemon tea with herbals and spices  Have a nice day to all my loving LGs⚘⚘💙🤝🤝Always keep safe and take prevention attempts to save from Covid 19.. Md.

323475,A journey by Train and view the natural beauties of Bangladesh,148,102.0,"
Heve you ever visited in my country, Bangladesh?Its a tropical zone and south east Asia, we are the last land in south side then only sea..Agriculture is our main profession of our country as most of the areas of whole country are in the village areas. In the Villag areas you may found only green nature like many kinds of  trees , paddy and vegetables fields,  many small and big ponds, lakes, canals and rivers.Many foreigners visit here only Dhaka and Chittagong city for business purposes, but the real nature can be found if you have journey by Train..A few days ago I had an experience like that , Generally I travelled Dhaka by Flight but this time I chose by Train. As my seat was inside an Aircondition compartment ant it was a sleeping room, all the windows and doors were kept locked in my booked room , and the windows are  made darken/smokey so I couldn't see perfectly from my room, then i went out and moved to the main door and opened it for few times to capture the beauty of the nature and villages in Bangladesh, I captured all the photos in Chittagong division  at Feni district area.About half a hour I captured natural beauty of Bangladesh from th Train door although it was little risky to capture photos from a running train, standing at the main door, but feel thrilling and adventurous. 😍🤗🤗#LetsGuide #LocalGuides #Chittagong #Bangladesh  Caption: A trin is running inside the nature and paddy field , captured by me with my Smartphone Samsung J7PRO from the door of that train.Caption: a house view inside a village area Caption: A village road and nature viewsCaption: A village road with a 3 wheelers auto and village people Caption: Many village views with road and houses views Caption: Beautiful green nature Caption: a bridge view with banana trees  Caption: a village road , a vehicle with green nature   Caption: A bridge over a river and boats in the river   Caption: Beautiful green nature and paddy fields with trees view   Caption: a lake view with a small house and trees   Caption: a Mosque gate view, lake view and trees view ina village   Caption: A trin is running inside the nature and paddy field , captured by me with my Smartphone Samsung J7PRO from the door of that train.Caption: A trin is running inside the nature and paddy field , captured by me with my Smartphone Samsung J7PRO from the door of that train.

323475,Introduce Yourself — April 2018,22,,"
Hi LG and friends of the world who love Google and Google maps!!Greetings to everyone from Chittagong, Bangladesh! Before introducing myself I thank and pay warm greetings to all the honorable Google Management Team, employees and members as well as all LGs and well wishers of Google for their great contributions for the world!!! And also thank a lot Google team to make the whole world a unique platform!!    From my very childhood I had a great interest and curiosity about all the Google activities n features. Google map helped me a lot to find out new places and addresses. Some places where I was new comer, Google Map helped me to trace the correct addresses. So I impressed a lot about Google Map and other Google activities, After then I inspired by Google Map and also fond of it. Now I have a great passion and determination to contribute and share something to Google Map and help the world to explore new things.  Name: Mahbub =  LG name : MAHBUB70HYDER - a simple Google Local Guide contributor of Level 8!!Location: Chittagong City (Stay exactly at Halishahar Housing Estate, Chittagong)What I love about being a Local Guide: I want to know more and more about the world, people , cultures and new communities. As a perfect traveler I love to take pictures of different places, different people, foods, cultures and many other things. I love being a local guide because I love to explore new places, share my experiences of those communities to others also i love to take photos everywhere I go and share in the Google map. I am a good traveler of my own country as well as other countries. So I got much experiences about many places, people and cultures, When I get any opportunity, I go out for travelling to explore something new. My knowledge allows me to share many beautiful places, business places, locations and other experiences to help others. I do believe my sharing helps the people to know more about the world and explore many new things and find the correct ways and make good decisions for them. Being a local guide I also gather much knowledge from the Google Map and LGs. My moral principle is to share everything correctly and honestly! I like to share and  guide the perfect things not to misguide people!! Lastly I can proudly say I am a ""Local Guide""!  This is also an amazing pleasure for me being a local guide to help the people by contributing something in Google!!My favorite thing to explore: As a man of travelling I travelled more then 500 places inside my countries as well as in abroad. A also love to take pictures every places I travelled and already shared more then 8000 photos to Google map. And try to explore many new things and also share and help others to get correct knowledge of those places. I feel very happy and proud when i see my shared photos are viewed by many people. When I look back at my past years of travels, I have to say that the key themes are to capture natural beauties like sunrise, sunset, river view, mountain views, lake views, waterfalls, national parks and sea views etc. I also shared photos of many new places, location, hotels and business places to help the people. I have a great desire to continue to contribute more and more to Google and try to make Google in the excellent and unmeasurable top position!! As well as make myself also great position in Google and LG!!Fun Fact about me: I’ve been writing reviews on Google Maps since 2017, I am a man of enjoying the moments, My nature is I try to find pleasure in my every works, so it is easier to me overcome all my works happily and successfully. All the natural beauties attract me a lot! So I love to travel any time i get a little opportunity. Also I have a great hobby to take picture every places I go, Besides that I like to make garden, pray to Allah, make some tours and camping program with my friends, watch movies and news in the TV, make fun and tour with my family in and abroad.

@DeniGu: This week, I chose to share with you not a post but a whole topic—ice cream in Japan! @HiroyukiTakisawa’s#monthlytopic for June is “We love Ice cream🍦🍨🍧,” and we’ve seen some great stories so far. I loved the unconventional ice creams @yamamo_cchi shared: the baked ice cream in Osaka and the soy sauce-covered one in Takamori, Kumamoto Prefecture. But that’s not all! If you’re in Machida, Tokyo, you may want to try the local soft cream on a pudding that @Izumi told us about. And, of course, Hiroyuki’s own recommendations for perilla and soy sauce ice cream and soft cream in Iwate Prefecture! Check out more ice cream varieties from around the world here.

@LilyanaZ: Local Guide @Erna_LaBeau’s post “Accessible Life in Google Earth - Elizabeth Park #Trenton #Michigan” is an amazing addition to @ermest’s project Accessible Life on Google Earth and my favorite this week. The park Erna introduces, Elizabeth Park, looks like a wonderful place with beautiful river scenery and many accessibility features. She created a map in Google Earth (her first ever!) that allows future visitors to explore dedicated accessible areas and more. If accessibility is important to you, too, head to Erna’s post. Get inspired by her experience and reviews on Google Maps and Ermes’s helpful tips!

@TsekoV: The post that caught my attention this week was @valencianoviajero's ""EL DÍA QUE CUMPLÍ UN SUEÑO… MI VIAJE A ROMA.” In it, he shares how he fulfilled his dream of visiting Rome back in 2019. I enjoyed reading about the different places he saw in just a few days—like the Pantheon, Trevi Fountain, and more—and liked his impressive photos of sights and local cuisine. Although the situation is different now from two years ago, this post could be a great reference to anyone who has Rome on their bucket list. If you’re looking for sightseeing and dining ideas, make sure to read @valencianoviajero’s post.

@LilyanaZ: This Pride Month, we’re loving Local Guide yesenia baez’s review of Fresco's Cantina, an LGBTQ+-friendly restaurant in New York. It looks like a checklist of the things they considered before giving the place a five-star rating. The restaurant seems to tick all the boxes when it comes to cozy ambiance, quality food, and friendly staff, and even themed days. The Local Guide also made sure to include a tip about what not to miss: the drag queen performances that can make your dining experience unique.

@KlaudiyaG: Another location that welcomes the LGBTQ+ community is the Milk Bar Logan Circle Flagship in Washington, DC, and it boasts the great photo you see above. It was taken by @SP31 from an angle that shows us the interior, some of the products on display, and the price menu. What’s more, there’s a sign on the clear counter about the COVID-19 measures the shop follows. Now you know what to expect at this milk bar, thanks to Steve’s photo on Google Maps!

@LilyanaZ: This week, the great post “Paraíso de Jirafas 🦒” grabbed my attention. In it, we go on a Serengeti-themed safari with @LaloPadilla at Bioparque Estrella, a place with a mission to teach people about the environment and the animals and how to take care of them. The animals there roam freely, approaching the visitors from time to time to get treats, and Lalo even got the chance to feed a giraffe! I have never seen a giraffe from that close and would love to one day experience everything that that beautiful park has to offer.

@MashaPS: It is always interesting to see the various ways in which Local Guides explore places near them. Recently, @Ddimitra took us to “5 Unique Markets in Jakarta.” Among them were a colorful flower market, a gem market, a sweets-and-snacks market, and more. What I liked the most about her post was Devi’s idea that visiting markets doesn’t mean you need to spend a lot of money. It is enough to walk around, take some photos, and just enjoy the feeling of exploration. And I share her view, too!
 
Caption: A photo of Laguna del Diablo, a lagoon in Ushuaia, Tierra del Fuego. (Local Guide @FaridTDF)
@Bobiisha: I truly enjoyed reading @FaridTDF’s post “Descubramos tesoros ocultos.” While looking up hiking trails around Ushuaia, he unexpectedly discovered a lagoon inside the city itself. Farid has shared some amazing photos of that hidden gem, which seems like the kind of natural spot I’d add to my bucket list. There is also a video of the lagoon and its surroundings to help you get immersed in the atmosphere. Have you recently discovered something new in your area? Then feel free to share it with Farid.

@TsekoV: Do you love French cuisine? If yes, then you should definitely check out @Nosaint2_Rafael_Fe’s recent post “Oh! Là Là..., Sabor Francés. From the serie, A taste of flavor from a different cardinal point.” In it, he continues his journey of exploring the “gastronomic diversity” of Puerto Rico. This time, he visited a restaurant that offers authentic French dishes and introduced the ones he tried: onion soup, filet mignon flamed with cognac, and sweet profiteroles. To learn more about them and see some mouth-watering photos, head to his post.

@LilyanaZ: Тhe post that captivated me this week was ”A journey to the Sitakunda - Khoiyachora Waterfalls.” In it, @ShafiulB takes us on a slippery hike to the Khoiyachora Waterfalls in Bangladesh through a mesmerizing jungle and over canals until we arrive at the majestic water cascade. As the trees in my country slowly put on their leafless winter attire, the greenery that Shafiul shows us through his photos and the refreshing view of the waterfall got me yearning for the same experience.

@KlaudiyaG: Last week, @StephenAbraham visited the Royal Selangor Visitor Center in Kuala Lumpur. He liked the experience so much that he decided to take the whole community on a virtual tour in his post “Royal Selangor Center - One of the best free places to visit Kuala Lumpur, with wheelchair access!.” What makes this place such a great spot for visitors are not only the unique pewter items on displays, the demonstrations, and the free entrance but also the fact that it is entirely accessible for wheelchair users. To find out more about Stephen’s visit and the center itself, make sure to check his post.

@AngieYC: The post “White Pocket, Vermilion Cliffs National Monument AZ, October 2019” by @GearHead caught my eye this week. In it, he shares some fascinating photos that capture the mystical beauty of White Pocket, an area within the Vermilion Cliffs National Monument in Arizona, USA. I also enjoyed reading about his experience there and felt like I was part of this journey myself.

@DeniGu: The Local Guide who gave us “A complete guide to Madeira” recently shared another wonderful compilation: “A complete guide to Istanbul: Getting around, things to do, where to eat.” @StephenLammens tells us about his 14-day trip to Istanbul, during which he garnered a lot of curious and helpful information that he shared with us on Connect. I love how he’s added some insider details, like getting an Istanbul card to use on every means of public transportation and looking for the street vendor around Galata Bridge who makes some of the best fish wraps. For these and more tips, head to Stephen’s post and don’t miss his Google Maps list.

840804,5 Local Guides photos to celebrate foliage season in South Korea,233,26.0,"
When I lived in South Korea, I absolutely loved the autumn season. The trees and flowers are a bit different from those back home, and the change of colors is a fascinating thing to witness. The vivid red maple leaves and the bright yellow ginkgo trees urge many to search for the perfect spot to enjoy the beauty of nature. 
 
As autumn unfolds in the Northern Hemisphere, we wanted to share with you five amazing Local Guides photos that capture the magic of the foliage season in South Korea.

840804,Review of the Month: Parque Lage by Local Guide Juan Ignacio Sepúlveda,31,6.0,"
Caption: A screenshot of Local Guide Juan Ignacio Sepúlveda’s review of Parque Lage in Rio De Janeiro, Brazil.
 
This month, we’re loving Local Guide Juan Ignacio Sepúlveda’s review of Parque Lage in Rio De Janeiro, a public park with lush greenery and diverse wildlife, which also attracts attention with the amazing architecture of the mansion inside it. 
 
In his review, Juan says: “A spectacular place. Keep in mind that you do not have to pay an entrance fee to visit this beautiful place. If you arrive early, you will not have to stand in long queues, since the mansion is in high demand. It is a special place to take incredible photos, with a clear view of Christ the Redeemer. To access the second floor [of the mansion], you have to buy one of the handicrafts that they offer. [...] There are a lot of green areas to explore, including an aquarium, and you can also see animals from up close swinging around the park.”
 
What we like about Juan’s review is that he gives advice on when to visit the park and the mansion to avoid crowds and capture some magnificent photos of the famous Christ the Redeemer. Although the entrance is free, he makes a point to say that a purchase is necessary to go to the second floor of the building. Juan didn’t miss to mention the other treasures of the park, like the green spaces, the aquarium, and the wild animals you can have a close encounter with.
 
You can read the full review here.

Every Friday, Google Moderators highlight the best posts they found to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. These are posts detailing past experiences that we hope will serve as entertainment and inspiration for your future bucket list. This week, a meteor shower, a sequoia park, and more.
 
Caption: A photo of a starry night sky with a meteor striking through it. (Local Guide @Erik_van_den_Ham)
@LilyanaZ: Every year, many people go to places outside of big cities to enjoy the Perseids meteor shower. I have wanted to go on a vacation to a secluded mountain area when this is happening for ages, but there was always something getting in the way. However, thanks to @Erik_van_den_Ham and his post, “Perseids Meteor Shower 2020,” I was able to enjoy this magical show through his lenses. He also gave some great details about the gear he used and shared useful links about the Perseids, so I highly recommend his post to any avid night sky photographer.

@TsekoV: While browsing through Connect, one post left a deep impression on me. It was @Kwiksatik’s post, “Where the Trees have Souls | #StateChallenge California.” Looking at the photos she shared, I could only imagine how tall the trees are at Redwood National and State Parks in California. Megan’s words are a reminder of how precious nature is and why we should preserve it. Our time on Earth, compared to the lives of trees and nature, is short, and we should cherish it all.
 
Caption: A photo of Local Guide @MaxWalsh looking at a stunning sunset over the Aegean Sea in Santorini, Greece. (Local Guide @MaxWalsh)
@Bobiisha: This week, I stumbled upon the post “SANTORINI, Place of the most beautiful sunsets -SUPER POST-” by Local Guide @MaxWalsh. It’s about his trip to the famous Santorini island in Greece. His post is very informative and full of tips on when to visit, how to get there, where to eat, and which places and activities you shouldn’t miss. What caught my eye at first were the stunning photos of sunsets and white buildings, but I found that his post contained all the information needed to plan a trip to the island. That is definitely a bucket list location.
 
Caption: A photo of the turquoise waters and green hills of Blaca Cove on Brač Island in Croatia. (Local Guide @Tomislav_CRO)
@AngieYC: Many Local Guides like to add beautiful destinations to their travel bucket list, including me. Croatia is now on my bucket list thanks to the post “Brač Island Tour - Golden Cape, Blaca Hermitage and an Abandoned Military Tunnel” shared by @Tomislav_CRO. In it, he takes us on a tour around the island of Brač, introducing the tourist-packed beach at Golden Horn, the peaceful Blaca Hermitage monastery, an old military tunnel, and the secluded beaches of Murvica. His post is helpful, and I will definitely take note of the tips he shared for a future trip. His photos are truly mesmerizing, too!

2. Location: Currently living in Sofia, Bulgaria, but I am from one of the most beautiful cities in Bulgaria, Burgas. 
3. What I love about being a Local Guide: I love discovering new places, finding new routes to get around, and reading and writing reviews. All of this, plus the fact that the community is so multicultural and supportive, makes being a Local Guide a great experience.

My favorite thing to explore: I love going to local supermarkets and taking a look at what types of food they offer and what the prices are like. Although I prefer to eat out, there is something very exciting about finding out what the variety of food sold at grocery stores in a different country is like.
 
Caption: A picture of a Strasbourg supermarket’s fridge full of different types of cheese. (Local Guide @LilyanaZ)5. Fun Fact about me: I adore spicy food, and I am always willing to try the spiciest dish on the menu. This has proven to be a big mistake at times, as I cannot proceed with eating while crying. I have also lived in Korea for three years: one in Daegu and two in Seoul.

840804,7 Local Guides photos that celebrate Prague's architecture,279,26.0,"
Have you ever walked around a city so mesmerized by the beauty of its buildings that you couldn’t stop looking up, even though your neck already started hurting and you’ve stumbled at least ten times? 
The last time this happened to me was when I visited Prague, Czech Republic. Before going there, I read about Prague’s diverse architecture and was surprised at how the different styles complemented each other. The plethora of unique structures left me so amazed that I couldn’t help but feel like I was in a fairytale. I wanted to take a photo of every single building, regardless of whether it was a landmark or not.October 7th is World Architecture Day, and I'm excited to share with you seven amazing photos of buildings in Prague, captured by Local Guides.

Today is International Cheeseburger Day. So let’s talk burgers!I’m a huge cheese lover who could indulge in a delicious, melted cheese-covered burger anytime. When I was a kid, there weren’t that many places in Bulgaria where we could get a burger. I still remember the joy I felt when my parents brought my sister and me a Happy Meal from the first McDonald’s that had just opened in a city almost 200 kilometers away! 
 
Restaurants and burger joints today offer something for every taste: from fast food to gourmet, to vegan and vegetarian burgers. So when my friends and I visit a burger place, we always check the reviews and photos Local Guides have shared to make sure it’s the right place for us. 
 
Here’s what we always look for.
 
What type of buns are they using?
It’s the inside that matters, but a bun makes half of the burger, therefore half of the taste.
 
How do they cook the meat?
Rare, medium or well-done? I would like mine well-done, thanks!
 
What options do they have for people who love spicy food?
Jalapeños or a spicy sauce? Yes, please!
 
Do they have vegetarian or vegan options?
Even a meat lover like me can appreciate a well-made vegan or vegetarian patty.
 
Do they have delicious fries?
Great places have great fries that complement the taste of their burgers.
 
What about them condiments?
Coleslaw, pickles or a wide variety of sauces that leave your taste buds tingling are crucial for enhancing the experience.
 
What’s the atmosphere of the place?
Of course, great ambiance and good service also play a role in our selection of a place, but we are talking burgers here! 
Will you be celebrating your love for burgers today? Share your photos and lists of favorite burger places in the comments below!

Every Friday, Googlers round up some of the best posts they came across during the week to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. This week, a bubble tea meet-up, an ice sculpture festival, and more. 
 
@Sorbe: The post “Pedreira - cidade das Porcelanas” by fellow Local Guide @alexandradias caught my eye this week. @alexandradias visited the city of Pedreira, located close to São Paulo, Brazil, which is famous for its original porcelain items that make for the perfect home decoration. I could really feel her excitement while she described the various activities she did in Pedreira—from trying delicious food in a restaurant full of nostalgic objects from the past to exploring the city center and some interesting old-time museums, to enjoying a cone of ice cream. Head over to @alexandradias’s post if you want to learn more about what this city has in store.

@KlaudiyaG: The post I’d like to highlight this week is called “[Recap] Malaysia Bobba Walk 2019 Meet-up” by Connect Moderator @StephenAbraham. In it, @StephenAbraham takes us on an incredible journey of discovering what this Malaysian trend of drinking bubble tea is all about. He and @AkmalB visited many different boba places in Kuala Lumpur, updating information on Google Maps and chatting with owners and staff while enjoying this sugary drink. If you want to know more about where they went and what their thoughts about boba tea are, make sure to check out his post.

@LilyanaZ: When I saw the thumbnail of @kroza's post “Chipas - #Team Argentina,” I knew I had to click on it, since it urged all cheese lovers to do so—and I am one! The post is another great addition to the ongoing #TeamChallenge and introduces a mouthwatering Argentinian snack called la chipa. La chipa is a type of cheese flavored bread and you can easily imagine how delicious it must be by looking at @kroza's photos and reading the enthused explanations of the team. @kroza also shares the origin of this snack, what ingredients you need to make it at home, where you can find it, and when to have it. This is definitely one more thing to put on your foodie bucket list, especially if you have the chance to visit Argentina.

@VitB : This week I want to share with you @Avraham_Jurado’s awesome post “Ice Sculpture Festival in Tierra del Fuego.” In it, @Avraham_Jurado tells us about the annual snow sculpture festival in Tierra del Fuego, Argentina which takes place every August. He also shows us many photos of the various sculptures, including the winning three. If you want to see what they look like, go ahead and check his post.

@IrrPavlova : This week “Murals of Lodhi Colony Delhi” by @Harfan_maula caught my attention. In it, @Harfan_maula introduces extremely impressive wall murals, full of social meanings and small details. I love how provocative the ideas behind them are. Every mural can spark a much needed discussion of important personal, social, and global issues. After all, it’s not everyday that a wall reminds you to call your mom!
 
@AlexaAC : I was captured by @uavalentine's post “Ode to Friendship or 48 hours in Munich, Germany” showing us how to celebrate friendship and create new memories. This is such an important part of life. @uavalentine visited Munich with a special friend and shared some great photos. My favorite one is of the Neuschwanstein Castle which is seen in Disney’s Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty stories. With @uavalentine's great tips and advice on where to go within 48 hours, you are able to explore the city like never before.

@sonnyNg : Have you already planned your summer vacation? If not, you may find your next destination in @christophesubilia's post “3 days in Porto : Surf, food and football ! .“ @christophesubilia takes us on a tour around Porto and it has everything you could want in a vacation—from shopping and food to football and surfing! He also shares a helpful list on Google Maps with all the places he mentions so that you can easily explore the city. I already have unconditional love for food and football, but learning how to surf might just be my next goal.

@LilyanaZ: “Versailles where everything is Gold” is my choice for this week. Joining Connect Moderator @ermest on his journey to the renowned Versailles Palace, Local Guides can enjoy stunning photos of artworks and golden ornaments, and get some tips for their visit there. @ermest introduces many different places in the palace, but my absolute favorite are the fountains! I feel like I could spend a whole day admiring the amazing statues inside the water cascades.

불가리아에서 고등학교를 졸업하고 나서 다음에 어떤 전공을 공부할 지 많이 고민했습니다. 1년 동안 경제학을 공부해 보았지만 저의 진정한 열정은 언어 배우기라는 것을 깨달았습니다. 그래서 관심이 없었던 전공을 바꾸기로 결정했고 한국학을 밟기 시작했습니다. 한국어는 불가리아어와 비교해서 엄청나게 다르고 문장의 구성까지 정반대라서 처음에 너무 어려웠지만, 곧 저의 마음을 사로잡는 언어로 되었습니다.
 
한국을 처음 방문하게 된 것은 여름 장학 프로그램을 통해서였고, 이내 한국과 푹 사랑에 빠졌습니다. 이 열병은 안락한 현실으로부터 벗어나게 한 원동력이 되었고 끝내 저는 석사학위를 쫓아 위해 한국으로 이동하기로 결심했습니다.
 
한국은 관광객들에게 매력적이고 마음을 사로잡는 국가지만, 관광객이 아닌 거주자로 반세계를 넘어서 이동하는 것은 도전적인 목표였습니다. 물론 그렇게 되어서 다행입니다. 지금생각해보면 이 결정을 한 제가 자랑스럽습니다. 여기 제가 불가리아인으로서 한국에서 경험한 4 가지 재미있는 경험을 소개합니다.
 
1. 현지인들이 내 나라에 대해 아는 놀라운 것들

자기 나라에 대해 누군가가 알고있을 때 따뜻한 느낌을 아시죠? 저는 새로운 사람을 만날 때마다 내가 어디에서 왔는지 물어올 때에 이 느낌 경험했습니다.
 
처음에 ""오, 불가리아! 요구르트! 불가리스! ""라는 말씀을 가장 많이 들었습니다. 우리가 사랑하는 요구르트의 건강상의 이점은 전 세계적으로 알려져 있으며 한국도 예외는 아니었습니다. 불가리스는 한국 요구르트 중에 가장 인기있는 브랜드중 하나입니다.
 
한국인들이 불가리아에 대해 또 다른 아는 것 중 하나는 우리가 생산하는 장미 오일이었습니다. 한국인은 화장품에 열광하고 피부 관리는 정말 중요한 일이기 때문에 이것은 놀랄 일이 아니었습니다. 불가리아에서 돌아온 후에 장미 기름을 선물로 가져오면 한국 친구들이 정말 좋아했습니다.
 
가끔 한국인들이 유명한 불가리아 사람들 때문에 우리 나라에 대해 알고 있었습니다. 1990 년대 초반 바르셀로나에서 뛰었던 축구 스타 Hristo Stoichkov를 기억하는 나이 많은 남자들이 있었고 젊은 남자들이 유명한 한국 선수 박지성과 동시에 맨체스터 유나이티드에서 뛰었던 또 다른 축구 선수 인 Dimitar Berbatov를 기억했습니다. 요즘에는 모든 한국인들이 서울의 불가리아 레스토랑 Zelen의 주인 Mihal Ashminov 요리사에 대해 알고있는 것 같습니다. 그는 한국 TV 프로그램 냉장고를 부탁해에 나타나서 인기를 얻었습니다.
 
2. 내가 좋아하는 치즈와 요구르트를 찾는 어려움
 
캡션: 지역 슈퍼마켓에 있는 유제품 코너의 사진 (지역 가이드 @LilyanaZ)
2010년 한국에 처음 방문했을 때 음식을 포함하여 한 달 동안 많은 경험을 했습니다. 저는 가능한만큼 모든 것을 맛보려고 최선을 다했습니다. 음식들이 얼마나 맛이있던지! 저의 입맛에 딱 맞는 한국음식에 완전히 매료되었습니다. 저는 매운 음식을 좋아하고 요리에 약간 불맛이 나는 것을 꺼리지 않기 때문입니다!
 
두 번째 방문에서 저는 한국으로 이주했고 3년간 머물렀습니다. 한국 음식에 대한 저의 사랑은 하나도 변하지 않았지만 종종 불가리아 음식이 그리웠습니다.많은 불가리아인들처럼 저도 요구르트를 엄청나게 좋아해서 현지 상점에서 여러 브랜드를 보게되어 매우 기뻤습니다. 그러나 한국의 요구르트의 단 맛은 제가 원했던 불가리아 신 맛을 가진 요구르트와 달랐습니다. 그럼에도 불구하고 저에게 익숙한 맛에 가까운 매일 바이오 플레인 요거트와 프리미엄 비피더스 플레인 요거트와 같은 몇 가지 브랜드를 찾을 수 있었습니다. 할머니의 지시에 따라 혼자서 만들어 본 적도 있었습니다.
 
또 정말로 그리워했던 것은 치즈였습니다. 작은 슈퍼마켓에서는 다양한 치즈 종류를 찾을 수 없었고, 햄버거 용으로 포장 된 치즈 조각만을 찾을 수 있었습니다. 그러나 큰 슈퍼마켓은 자주 큰 유제품 코너가 있었고 저는 하얀 치즈를 페타 치즈로 치환했고, 우리 노란색 치즈 대신에 피자 치즈를 많이 샀습니다. 요즘에는 많은 식당에서는 치즈를 토핑으로 제공하기 하기도하고 치즈가 흔해졌지만, 불가리아에 갈 때마다 한국에 돌아오기 전에 치즈 팩을 꼭 움켜 쥐곤 했습니다.
 
3. 스마트폰을 갖는 것의 중요성
 
캡션: 서울 지하철 열차를 타는 사람들이 있는 흐릿한 배경에 헤드폰이 장착 된 스마트 폰을 들고있는 손 사진 (Getty Images)
저는 2013년 한국에서 처음으로 스마트폰을 구입했습니다. 추세에 조금 늦었지만 불가리아에서 스마트 폰은 그때에 아직 유명하지 않았고 오래된 핸드폰으로도 간단한 전화는 정상적으로 할 수 있었습니다. 하지만 한국에서 만났던 한국 친구들은 채팅 앱을 통해 계속 계획을 세웠고 연락을 주고받는 것이 스마트폰 없는 저에게는 좋은 경험이 아니었습니다. 밖에서 약속이 있을 때 장소가 바뀔 때마다 저는 컴퓨터 없이는 메시지를 읽을 수 없었고 혼선을 피할 수 없었습니다.
 
스마트폰을 구입 한 후, 저는 이 때까지 많은 것을 놓치고 있었다는 것을 깨달았습니다. 저의 일상생활은 훌륭한 앱들 덕분에 훨씬 안락해졌습니다. 가장 유용한 앱은 의사 소통을 위한 앱이었습니다. 대학 교수님께서도 수업을 위한 대화방을 만들어 중요한 정보를 공유하셨습니다. 한국인이 전화하는 것보다 문자 메시지 보내기를 선호한다는 것을 느끼게 되었습니다. 제가 만난 새로운 사람들은 제 번호 대신 채팅 앱에서의 닉네임을 달라고 요청했습니다.
 
저는교통 정보를 제공하는 앱을 제일 자주 사용했습니다. 모든 버스와 지하철의 일정이 지속적으로 업데이트되어서 정말 편리했습니다. 심지어 다음에 들어오는 두 개의 지하철 열차의 방향에 대해서도 알 수 있었습니다.
앱은 쇼핑, 온라인 뱅킹, 음식 주문을 위해 사용했고 거대한 대도시 지역의 수많은 길 위에서 길을 잃지 않고 목적지를 찾는 데 큰 도움이 되었습니다.
 
4. 카페 문화
 
캡션: 카페의 메모가 흩어진 테이블 위에, 한국 문법책과 휘핑 크림과 말린 오렌지 조각으로 장식된 카페인 음료 한 잔의 사진 (지역 가이드 @LilyanaZ)
저에게, 카페에 가는 것은 항상 사교 행사였습니다. 이전에는 친구들을 만나고 잠시 이야기를 나누기 위해서만 카페에 가곤 했습니다. 서울의 거의 모든 구석에 카페가 있다는 것에 놀랐습니다. 그리고 카페에서 많은 사람들이 혼자 책을 읽거나 공부하거나 노트북을 사용하여 수업을 준비하는 많은 사람들이 혼자 앉는것을 처음에 어색하다고 생각했습니다.
 
불가리아에서는 음료를 마친 후에는 카페에 오래 머물지 않습니다. 그러나 한국에서는 그렇지 않았습니다. 하루 종일 카페에 머무를 수 있었고 아무도 저에게 가라고 충고하지 않았습니다. 나는 처음에는 카페에 혼자 가는 것이 조금 불편했지만, 저는 엄청난 커피 애호가였으며 이내 공부나 학교 프로젝트에 집중해야 할 때마다 카페에 가는 것이 습관이 되었습니다.
 
저는한국 사람들이 커피도 좋아한다는 것을 알게 되었습니다. 일몰 후까지도 대부분 친구들은 식사 후에 커피를 마시러 갈 것을 자주 제안했습니다.
 
또한 저에게 매혹적이었던 것은 많은 독특한 카페들이었습니다. 애니메이션을 테마로한 원피스 (One Piece) 카페도 있었고 드레스 업 카페, 프린세스 다이어리 카페 있고, 그리고 제가 가장 좋아하는 동물 카페도 다양한 종류가 있었습니다. 거의 모든 동네에서 개와 고양이 카페를 쉽게 찾을 수 있었지만 너구리, 양, 미어캣, 토끼가 있는 카페가 가장 재미있다고 생각했습니다.
 
많은 카페에서는 고객이 계산대로 쿠폰 카드를 가져오면 주문한 각 음료수마다 스탬프를 받고, 10 번째 음료수를 무료로 받을 수 있습니다.
 
다른 언어와 문화에 대해서 더 잘 이해하기 위해 해당 국가에서 직접 체험하는 것보다 더 좋은 방법은 없습니다. 한국에 살면서 어려움도 많이 있었지만 즐겁게 공부하고 관광객이 아닌 거주자로서 이곳을 즐기기로 결심했습니다.
 
자기 나라를 방문하려는 사람들이 꼭 알아야 할 것이 있다면 무엇일까요? 아래 댓글에 공유해주세요.

840804,"Friday Favorites: West Bali National Park, Marble Caves, and more",98,10.0,"
Every Friday, Googlers round up some of the best posts they came across during the week to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. This week, animals you can find at West Bali National Park, Marble Caves in Chile, and more. 
 
@Sorbe: This week, @ermest shared his experience exploring Treviso, Italy with fellow Local Guides in the post “RECAP - 3-Viso 3-60 -.” During the meet-up, the group experimented with 360 photography, saw beautiful architecture, and enjoyed traditional Venetian cuisine. You should definitely check out the Google Photos album from the meet-up, especially because it includes photos of tiramisu, my favourite sweet, which was invented in this city.

@LilyanaZ: When thinking of Bali, the first thing that comes to mind are the beaches and all the resorts—especially now when it is so cold and snowy outside in Bulgaria. @Mahmur-Marganti's post “Merasakan Bali dengan cara Berbeda,” (or “Feeling Bali in a different way”), really shows a different side of this Indonesian island—one that will get you in an adventurous mood. The post took us to West Bali National Park where we can see many different beautiful animals. Seeing these animals in their natural habitat and enjoying the great nature scenery surrounding you, to me personally, seems as an even better getaway than beaches.
@PoliMC: My favorite post for this week is “kerstmarkt soest duitsland” written by Local Guide @trails2track. It in, he describes his experience visiting a Christmas market in Soest, Germany where you can buy culinary specialties, have fun, and get lost in the holiday spirit. What I like about @trails2track post is that he included details about the city’s history. The most interesting thing I learned is that Soest, a city that is more than 1,000 years old, “is dominated by numerous interesting buildings built from typical green sandstone.”

@MoniV: “Marble chapels, a place to admire” is a great post to read this week. I enjoyed the amazing pictures that @FaridTDF shared with us and the amount of detail he included about his experience exploring the Marble Caves nature preserve in Chile. After seeing his post and his wonderful photos, I would like to visit this place more than ever. I want to thank @FaridTDF for the great posts he is sharing and to encourage him to do more and more amazing posts and photos.

1023613,The Colorful Recreational life of RMG Workers in Bangladesh,95,26.0,"
A group of RMG worker dancing in cultural programThe worker and the industry is very intertwined, integrated and interdependent. We always talk more about the industry and don’t talk much about the good part of the workers. So, my intension is to discover the untold story of the workers of Apparel Industry where worker’s making difference. So, would like to dedicate this post to the workers of Bangladesh RMG industries.Fashion Show by  participating workersEven working hard round the year, workers are very enthusiastic to expose their cultural talents to enjoy unlimitedly and they are even motivated to immerse themselves in complete joy. would like to share their unrevealed story for appreciating their joy. A Photo Collage of worker's dancing performance in various factoryBasic life of Workers:The workers of apparel industry maintain a very simple life, their needs and demands are limited. The worker’s earnings spent on basics like food & house rent for the family members. As they have to lead life depending on low income, so hardly maintain an improved quality of family life.Interestingly, in most cases Bangladeshi apparel worker’s family depending on their income. So, those families are totally woman depending as maximum workers are female. Here an example of woman empowerment and self-reliance has been established and recognized. Various games activities with worker's participation Recreational Colorful Life of workers:Living into poverty, the workers are much more proactive in recreation. So, they are very much talented on extra curriculum activities and cultural performance, even they are also very good in various sports activities. Which may be comparable with professional performers. In every garments factory in Bangladesh dedicate a day particularly for worker’s entertainment. This is day workers given opportunity to show their extra talents of cultural and games performance. This is the only day of aspiration & a day of longing in every year for the worker to enjoy the day on their own with many excitements to get relief from the tiredness of everyday work pressure.Variety of Cakes prepared by workers and present in the  cake festival It is mentionable that, the most of the RMG factory owner also very much progressive to consider a day for the worker’s happiness and motivation, where the underprivileged workers are privileged.Some moments of joy of the workersWorkers celebrate the day in an extreme festival mood with enthusiasms and happiness.

The industry already recognized as a major contributor to achieve economic prosperity of Bangladesh. So, the county already achieved strong economic advancement in the last couple of years and ensure a substantial growth in the National Income depending on apparel industry as a single biggest export earning of the country, 84% of total export earnings from the industry, which valued approximately 34.13 billion dollars contributing around 12% in national GDP.

The organization is a nonprofit charitable organization, we had our first event where we provided iftar among the underprivileged people on the street during Ramadan in the month of May,2019 and then in December,2019 we distributed winter clothes in the remote areas of Sirajganj. In the year 2020, When the whole world including our country affected by corona pandemic and lockdown starts, we thought of doing something for the low-income people as because they would be in the hardest due to incomeless.  A group of young friends including my son studying in college, who shared the same dream to work together, to eradicate poverty and to help the underprivileged people for their survival in the devastating situation. With very little fund and paramount desire, they started their journey with Blessing for Human Foundation as the organization came forward to help the underprivileged people of our society, aspiring to make a change in this humanitarian catastrophe.Food distribution in the different district of Bangladesh during Covid Pendamic 2020We were able to reach and support over 5000 families with a goal to eradicate hunger for the people who struggle to make ends meet, people who live from hand to mouth and cannot afford being out of work. the projects like “Covid-19 Relief Distribution” and “Coast to Coast” which vitalized them to distribute groceries throughout the different districts of Bangladesh including Dinajpur, Nilphamari, Shatkhira, Noakhali , Kishoreganj, Koyra, Keraniganj, Dhamrai, etc. Narrating the quintessence of the month of Ramadan, this organization provided over Iftaar as a part of their “Feed the Hungry” project.  Amidst all the chaos, our country was hit by the strongest cyclone ever recorded in this region.

Her entrepreneur struggle starts since 2010 by forming a company i. e. K2K Wear International for doing handicrafts and other craft item business purpose. But, she was not at all satisfied with the craft business, because product demand was very low in the market. While she was looking for alternative product for business stability she tried with many products and finally she picked jute product for manufacturing. Because, in Bangladesh jute is available but jute product market is totally unbalanced as well as product variation is less. Also, Bangladesh has a very long history of jute manufacturing & Exporting. Because of that, there was a saying that, “Jute is the golden fiber of Bangladesh”. It is to be mentioned here that, the largest jute mill in Asia i.e. Adamjee Jute Mills was situated in Bangladesh.  Also, she has taken the challenge and opportunity together by keeping in mind the tradition of jute in Bangladesh.It is to be mentioned here that His only son, Abdullah Khalid Ibrahim, was the inspiration behind his indomitable entrepreneurship.Jute Products Factory visit of BDLG MembersJute Products show to the BGLD membersHer journey with the jute products manufacturing begins just in the end of 2018. But, it was really struggling for her as started without knowing anything about jute and not even knowing any one from the industry. Also, it was really difficult for her to move many places for gather knowledge. Finally, she made it successfully only because of her hard pursuit and apathy. In the first year of her business she has shown daringness by participating in the “international Tread Fair, Bangladesh. Which was really a tough decision for her according to her stated. Today she has given employment of 15 permanent worker & staffs and around 80 workers are working with her on piece rate basis.

Hi I am very much delighted to share you about one the oldest Bridge “The Tiberius Bridge”. I could not miss the opportunity to visit the place while visiting Rimini, Italy  in November 2017 as It’s one of the oldest and best preserved bridge in the world.Me @SirajulAzad in front of Tiberius BridgeThe Tiberius Bridge is one of the oldest Bridge in Europe. The Bridge of Augustus and Tiberius, commonly known as the Bridge of Tiberius, whose first stone was laid down during Augustus reign in province of Rimini, Emilia-Romagna region in Italy. It is located on one of the ends of the city’s main street in Rimini. The Tiberius Bridge with name tag. Picture Credit Me @SirajulAzadHistory written near to the Tiberius Bridge Picture Credit Me @SirajulAzadIn 14 A.D the Emperor Augustus ordered for building that bridge over the Marecchia River in Rimini to ensure as most important roads for connecting the Via Emilia with north route – the bridge set the milestone as the starting of Via Emilia.  After Seven years in 21 AD the bridge was completed under the rule of new Emperor Tiberio. According to the inscription on the inner parapet of bridge has mentioned the names of both emperors. Different Angle Photo of the Tiberius Bridge. Picture Credit : InternetAfter building the bridge, Rimini became a central crossroad in the road system of the Roman Italy. The new bridge did not just mark only the beginning of the Via Æmilia headed to the heart of Northern Italy to Bologna and Piacenza. But it was also the start of Via Popilia headed to Ravenna and Adria. In addition, also Via Flaminia towards Rome and the street that leads to Arezzo across the Apennines touched the city of Rimini.Wide angle and night view of the Tiberius Bridge. Picture Credit : InternetAlso, during 14 A.D. the colony of Rimini needed reconstruction of the infrastructures of its residential area after the Civil Wars and the bridge was also part of it. As one of the old heritage, the bridge survives during many calamities with the glory by overcoming various natural disaster and battels risky pastures/events, such as from earthquakes, floods, from usury to war episodes - the attack inflicted by Narsete in 551, during the war between Goths and Byzantines of which the signs remain in the last arch towards the village of San Giuliano. Lastly during World War II in 1944, the Battle of Rimini took place between the Allied powers and Germany. In an attempt to stop the Allied offensive, the Germans destroyed all the bridges on the Marecchia River. But the Bridge of Tiberius faced every attempt of destruction, even the explosive charges failing to ignite. There are many BRIDGES in Europe are still standing after two millennia. But, The Tiberius Bridge on the river Marecchia in Rimini which is one of the exception of few as still in use as important part of the road system as modern bridges.😉 Railing by stone  in old structure  of the Tiberius Bridge.

Around 140 private and Non-government organizations/companies are working in this sector in collaboration with government international development agencies to create awareness, selling energy equipment’s for using renewable energy, preventing energy waste in residential, commercial & industrial sectors by saving and conserving energy as well as ensuring its efficient use. The remarkable good news for Bangladesh is that, the 27 Eco-friendly/green establishments are listed in the top 10 ranking in the world and 14 are from Bangladesh, which are LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environment Design) certified from USGBC (U.S. Green Building Council). As of now, Total 144 establishments in Bangladesh has received LEED certificate received from USGBC.

Special marking for Tracking COVID-19 testing Lab and Hospital facilities in Google MapsBangladesh is one of the densely populated country. So, day by day people are affecting by COVID-19 and the scenario is getting worst. The government testing facilities is struggling with the increasing number of test seekers. So, Considering the overall situation, government stimulating the testing operation and allows some private hospital and labs for COVID-19 test beside government hospital and labs. But, it is very difficult and challenging for people to find out COVID-19 testing lab and Hospital facilities due to lack of awareness. As a result, sometime people go faraway leaving near one to get the service. Also, it is very hard to know for people that, exactly which lab or hospital is assigned for providing COVID-19 services. It would be suggested to mark the COVID-19 testing lab and Hospital facilities in the google maps with a special symbol to track the locations easily for getting immediate service and support smoothly.The same idea can be applicable for other countries as well. I already shared a the list of Private COVID-19 Testing Centers as approved by the Government of Bangladesh as link below:https://goo.gl/maps/Nw1qJVFH6j72xu6t9

In this corona pandemic we are in isolation and quarantine, the animals appear to have gotten a free dominion on the busy roads in metropolitan areas. Rare cases of animals roaming the city streets are being observed many places around the world. People are sharing related information online and social media.
 
Same thing happens in my area; 2 times I have seen a big number of monkeys appear on the busy road. It is to be mentioned here, almost every day I use this main road to go & come from my office in the last 6 years, monkey never caught in my eyes in this area.

Hi, LG’s friends. How are you all! Hope you are well. Last Friday (11th June) we six local guide friends decided to go to the banks of the river Padma. The purpose of going was two. To see the dream Padma Bridge built on the river Padma. And attending the 7th Anniversary of 'Bangladesh Local Guide'. Caption: I am standing on the bank of the river Padma. Picture taken by LG @KapilDD The starting time of the '7th anniversary meetup of Bangladesh Local Guides' was scheduled at 3:30 pm. So we decided to go to the banks of the Padma first. It is located in Mawa. And after seeing the Padma River & Padma bridge, we will have lunch on the bank of Padma. Then we will go to the meetup venue Project Hilsa and join the meetup. On the morning of 11th June, we booked a Micro-bus and left Dhaka for Mawa. Those who were my tour companions @KapilDD @Arafat_Zakir @Ayeshashimu @RafsanRana & @SazzadShawon  Caption: We're all in the Micro-bus Caption: We're all in the Micro-bus The Padma Bridge is being built, so the Dhaka-Mawa  road has been improved. This road used to be two lanes, but now it has been upgraded to four lanes. Although this road is not very busy at present. We were quite enjoying its beauty on the way to Mawa. The road quality is good. It didn't take us long to reach Mawa .  The dream Padma Bridge under construction. Picture LG @Designer_Biswajit The dream Padma Bridge under construction.

Picture LG @Designer_Biswajit Caption: Me with LG @RafsanRana on the bank of the river Padma. Caption: LG @Ayeshashimu is standing on the bank of the river Padma with an umbrella. Anyway, we reached the banks of the Padma at 12:00 noon. We had until 1:30 pm to enjoy the place. This was my first visit after the Padma Bridge started. The place where we were staying by the river was very beautiful and enjoyable. From there the Padma Bridge looked quite beautiful. I was overwhelmed for a while, when I saw for the first time the biggest and the 'dream bridge of all the people of the country' built on the river Padma. Anyway, from there at 1:30 in the afternoon we went to a traditional restaurant located a little further away. Where we finished lunch with some traditional food. The main attraction of the food menu was Fried Hilsa (Hilsa is our national fish). We all enjoyed the meal together. Caption: A photo collage of traditional Bengali Foods, which we eat as lunch during that day. At the end of lunch, our destination was Project Hilsa, the venue of the meet-up organized on the occasion of 'Bangladesh Local Guides 7th years celebration'. We got there at exactly 3:00. And we joined about 120 local guide friends. After completing the registration, I entered the venue. Caption: LG @Arafat_Zakir standing in front of 'Project Hilsa' restaurant. Caption: Me standing in front of 'Project Hilsa' restaurant. Caption: A group photo in front of 'Project Hilsa' restaurant.Project Hilsa (Meetup Venue):This restaurant is currently one of the most popular restaurants in our country. It started its journey just two months ago. This was my first visit here. This is a pretty modern restaurant. The second floor of the two-story restaurant was allocated for our meetup. Caption: A group photo inside of 'Project Hilsa' restaurant with  LG friends.As always, all the arrangements of this meetup of 'Bangladesh Local Guide' were quite enjoyable. We all enjoyed this meetup hosted by Sirajul Azad for about three hours. Many thanks to @SirajulAzad vai and @MahabubMunna vai (the moderator of Bangladesh Local Guides), for successfully organizing this meter in such a beautiful venue. And also thanks for inviting me in this meet-up. Caption: A selfie with @SirajulAzad (Host of this meetup) Then after completing the meetup we left for Dhaka again. Thanks everyone for reading my post. 🙏 Regard

We lost our childhood. With that, many games have been lost from our life. Now, when I think of these games, I remember my playmates. I remember the lost games and memories of childhood. When you hear the word 'childhood', it is as if the world of a Gray story comes to the fore. A time that is unimportant and thoughtless. How much I did at that time! How much mischief and how much play! When I think about my childhood, I remember thousands of memories of my playmates and playgrounds. I don't know, where are all my childhood playmates now? A group photo with the boys before playing footballI know you all have the same state of mind. Let's provoke that memory a little more. A few days before this COVID-19 epidemic, I had the opportunity to visit my village home in Manikganj! That time, on a beautiful afternoon, when I went for a walk, I saw the boys of my village playing football on a beautiful ground! I couldn't resist the urge to go back to childhood for a while! I joined them without wasting any time. A photo after playing football Do you have any stories of going back to your childhood? If you have, you can share it with us here!Thanks everyone.

634147,Riverine beauty of Bangladesh,127,78.0,"
Hi Local Guides,Hope you all are well. Bangladesh is called the land of rivers. Major Bangladeshi rivers are Padma, Meghna, Jamuna, Brahmaputra and Karnaphuli. It has been an inseparable part of people as they bring happiness and sorrows when it makes floods.  The beauty of the river always fascinates me (Photo taken by my best friend 'Shuchitro')Many poems and songs are written for the rivers and its contribution. Some are known as more poetic for its flow, deeds and countryside view.  Beauty of the Kaliganga river (Picture: LG Designer_Biswajit)A little long boat trip on a river or a trip by Launch/Steamer is the best way to see the riverine beauty of Bangladesh. It will give you an opportunity to see the real beauty of Bangladesh as you will see beautiful countryside, working people, fishing, cultivation, crops and fields.  Beauty of the Kaliganga river (Picture: LG Designer_Biswajit)These pictures were taken from the Kaliganga river side by my Samsung Galaxy A50s. This is an awesome place to spend time with friends every afternoon. I will try every time to visit this place when I am in my village home. If you want to go to the banks of this beautiful river, you have to come to Manikganj first. Then, take a 'CNG Auto Rickshaw' or Laguna & come directly to the Burundi riverside terminal. CNG Auto Rickshaw fare almost 250-300 BDT ($3.0-4.0). Thanks everyone.Satay home as much as possible, Stay safe.

Caption: A ‘Family Day’ banner design with pictures of me and my loved wifeHappy Family Day to you and your loved family! Wishing you a lot of love and happiness. Hold on to each other, because you will always have your family, even when the world is falling apart. Why do we celebrate Family Day?The International Day of Families is observed on the 15th of May every year. The International Day provides an opportunity to promote awareness of issues relating to families and to increase knowledge of the social, economic and demographic processes affecting families. (Source)  Caption: A photo collage with our happy moment Caption: A photo collage with our happy momentResearch shows traditions are important to families because they build strong relationships between generations. Because these customs are so cherished, children often remember these special experiences from the holiday season more than the toys or gifts they receive. Caption: A group photo with my familyFamily is not just a bunch of people who are related to you. Family is a group of people you choose to be by your side no matter what. You choose them to be with you for the rest of your life. And this is the most precious gift of God. Caption: A photo collage with our happy momentFamily first. These two words occupy my mind, letting me understand that I do believe that there is nothing more important than family. There’s a beautiful long life waiting for us. So glad we can spend it together. Thanks everyone

634147,The Taj Mahal of Bengal (বাংলার তাজমহল),232,72.0,"
The 'Tajmahal of Bengal' is a replica of the Agra Taj Mahal. It's a masterpiece created like Agra Tajmahal. It's a symbol of love. Beautiful place for outing with kids and family. Last year I went to visit this beautiful place with my family. Really, the day was very enjoyable for us. Caption: The Tajmahal of Bangladesh (LG Designer_Biswajit)If you want at the end of the lockdown you can also go there, hope you like it very much. Caption: Me in front of The Bangladeshi Tajmahal Caption: A close view of the Bangladesi Tajmahal How to reach (from Dhaka):By Private CarIf you start your journey from Gulistan Bus stop of Dhaka, then you can follow Dhaka-Chittagong highway. After reaching Madanpur, turn Left to Gazipur Road, then Perabo, where Banglar Tajmahal is located. By BusFrequent bus services to Sonargaon operate from Gulistan, Saidabad bus stands in Dhaka. Tickets may be bought on roadside counters. The price of the ticket from the Gulistan bus stand is around BDT 40.00 (0.5$), and the ride may take about 40 minutes, depending on the unpredictable traffic. You have to get down from the bus at Kanchpur Bus Stop. From the Kanchpur Bus Stop, you have to take an autorickshaw, and have to tell the driver to drop you at 'Banglar Tajmahal'. This will require BDT 150.00 (2$) for the lift. Tips:Interestingly some people visit this place to compare the original Tajmahal with the artificial one. But, If your intention is to compare then it would seem very odd and irrational to you. I would like to suggest you enjoy & observe the Architectural property of this building rather comparing. Caption: Four  entry ticket in my hand Caption: Rajmoni Piramid (LG Designer_Biswajit) During the night it is more beautiful to see with extraordinary lighting which really enhances the eye. This place is very crowded on every holiday. The cost of entry is 150 taka per person. Although, with this same ticket you can visit another beautiful place of the same owner. That is the Rajmani Pyramid. It is located 300 yards from the Taj Mahal. You can read more about Banglar Taj Mahal in wikipedia. Click Here

We have been in lockdown for almost 35 days because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Although, during this time we have done some virtual meetups.

An extremely refreshing juice made from cucumber mixed with lemon and mint, not only refreshing but packed with healthy benefits. Perfect for the summer weather, this cucumber juice not only refreshes you but provides the benefits of ""cooling"". Benefits of Cucumber juice:Cucumber juice is a very healthy and versatile drink. Cucumbers have a high content of water and contain noteworthy amounts of potassium, silica, vitamin A, vitamin C and chlorophyll, among other nutrients. Many people add cucumber juice to their diets to improve the quality of their skin, nails, and hair, and when consumed regularly, the drink can help treat high blood pressure and kidney stones. Cucumber Juice, Picture LG Designer_Biswajit Ingredients:You really only need cucumbers and water to make cucumber juice, but I like adding lemon, mint, Bit Salt & Sugar for their added nutritional benefits and flavor. 1 Cucumber (Medium)400 ml Cold Water1 tablespoon sugar1 tablespoon Lemon Juice3/4 Mint Leaf½ Tea Spoon Bit Salt Lemon, Mit Leaf & Cucumber Slice, Picture LG Designer_Biswajit Let’s Make:At first peel your cucumber. You can accomplish this task by using either a potato peeler or a sharp knife with a smooth blade.Place all of the ingredients into a food processor or in a blender, and blend the ingredients until smooth. Blend the ingredients for at least two minutes. This is especially important if you don’t have a strong blender. The speed and duration of blending is what helps with the perfect consistency.Pour the cucumber juice into glasses.Let’s drink, cheers Cucumber Juice on Blender, Picture LG Designer_Biswajit Tips:Drink the juice as soon as you’ve made it. Since the ingredients start to lose their nutrients once they are oxidized. If you are making it ahead of time, store it in an airtight container or cover with plastic wrap and keep it in the fridge. Drink it within 24 hours. Cucumber Juice on Glasses, Picture LG Designer_Biswajit Thanks everyoneStay home as much as possible.

Hope that all of you are passing good days. I’m Biswajit Chakraborty from Bangladesh is very much proud to inform you that Bangladesh Local Guides (BDLG) is going to be 6 years old in the upcoming month (March 2020). On this enjoyable moment, I’m going to host a meetup. At this meetup, we are going to celebrate the 6th years anniversary with cake and food. Knowledge sharing would be a part of the program as well.

To arrange this meetup, we choose a newly built food court in Dhaka as the venue. Because it has a lot of open space to hangout/fun and many of the restaurants aren’t added on maps yet. So many information needs to be updated. We’ll try our best to cover those missing information. 

What will happen at this event: 
Photo walk & maps editing. 
Add missing information.
How to capture a 360° image using a mobile phone and a 360° camera. 
General discussion about Google Maps and Connect Forum. 
Discussion and knowledge sharing for the Connect Live 2020 application.

Along with this, we would try to arrange some fun games. After food, we would finish the program with flying Fanus (Sky lantern). 

But the sad part is seats are limited. So, we’ve to go through the registration process.

634147,"The story of building a Blood relationship with 'Bangladesh Local Guides (BDLG)""",234,96.0,"
Hello everyone!I’m Biswajit ChakrabortyAlready many of you know that a few days back me with my wife and the only daughter faced an unexpected road accident. I’m glad that many of you kept me in touch with phone calls and messages. I tried to reply to all of you but I might miss replying, please forgive my limitations. But the good news is with all of your love and prayer now we are quite a good condition, though I have to be completely on bed rest a few more days.Many of you might not know that, a few days back I had to have a surgery, which was held in “Health and Hope Hospital” at the Dhanmondi area. Through this surgery, I made “Blood relation” with Bangladesh Local Guides (BDLG). My this writing is mainly for telling this story!  Before the surgery doctors told to manage one bag of Blood. I told @SShuvo  bhai to let our community know. Then he wrote a post on our communities fb group. Many local guides show their interest to donate blood. But @MukulR brother is exceptional. Though were are not known to each for many days, his interest made me speechless, happy. He came from Mirpur (around one hour journey) by himself to donate blood and he stayed in the hospital until the surgery finished.As, Mukul brother and me, both are members of the Bangladesh Local Guides community. So, now I can say that I’ve got a blood connection with Bangladesh Local Guides (BDLG) / Local guides.I can’t thank Mukul brother yet, because I’m not getting any word how to thank him!On my surgery day, around 10 members of the BDLG core team were present there. I not mentioning any of their names as I might miss anyone’s name. They were in the hospital to give mental support to me and my family. I was too much happy to see them after the operation. There were there whole surgery time, it was around 3 hours. I can’t find any words to show gratitude to them. I’m grateful to them. After waiting three long hours, when they (BDLG core team) heard surgery is successful, the smile came out like this Naturally when a person or animal in danger we usually see all of his/her family members come forward to save him/her. Bangladesh Local Guides (BDLG) also make an example regarding this. By this matter, I learned that Bangladesh Local Guides (BDLG) community is not only working to develop Google Maps but also presenting themselves as a Family! And I’m very much proud and happy to be a part of this awesome family. Thanks, everyone for reading my story.Please stay safe, especially on the road/ journey.With great mapping please come forward to help mankind as well.

634147,Crispy Piyaju (কুড়কুড়ে পেঁয়াজু): A popular street food in Bangladesh,101,29.0,"
Piyaju is a lentil and onion fritter which is a very popular snack in Bangladesh. Especially, during Ramadan time piyaju is a must for iftar. It is a crispy snack and very tasty. This Piyaju I try at Kaitara Bazar in Manikganj. That was really very tasty & crispy. Also it is easy to make at home. I am trying to share this recipe with you. Hope you enjoy! Crispy Piyaju, Ready to eat Piaju is being fried in deep oil INGREDIENTSMaida: 4 tbspRice flour: 2 tbspRentil flour: 2 tbspBengal gram flour: 2 tbspTurmeric powder: ½ tspRed chilli powder: ½ tspRoasted Cumin powder: ½ tspSalt: ¼ tspWater: ½ cupWhite Oil for deep fryingOnion, large: 2 pcsGreen chilli: 2, finely choppedGinger: 1 tbspMustard oil: 2 tbsp  INSTRUCTIONSTake a deep bottomed pan which is suitable for deep frying and heat oil on medium flame. The depth of the pan should be more than 2 inches.Mix all the dry ingredients in a large bowl. Add water gradually little by little and keep whisking. Don’t add entire water together; this will make a large lump. Add little water, whisk to mix it thoroughly and then add again and so on. This will ensure lump free smooth matter.Now add 2 tbsp of hot oil into the batter and whisk quickly. This hot oil will make the batter silky and fries crispy. Add ginger and green chilli to the batter and mix well. Finally add thinly sliced onion to the batter and toss well so that each onion slice gets coated with the batter. There shouldn’t be any batter left after that; otherwise pakoda will be soft, not crispy.Now 1 tbsp batter at a time and slide in hot oil carefully. You may use your hand for the same. Don’t just drop the batter coated patty in hot oil, slowly slide it in. this way there will be no oil spluttering.Keep the flame on medium and cook pyazi for 3-5 mins. Flip gently on other side and cook for another 3-4 mins on medium flame. If kanda bhaji is evenly coloured and puffed up, your pyaz ke pakode is done. Remove from oil with slotted spoon and keep on kitchen towels to get rid of excess oil.wow, your piyaji is ready to eat. Thanks everyone

পানের কথা মনে করতেই প্রথমে মনে পড়ে গেল লালন ফকির এর বিখ্যাত গানটি-“ঘাটে লাগাইয়া ডিঙ্গা, পান খাইয়া যাও মাঝি, আল্লার দোহাই“আমাদের বাংলাদেশে ঐতিহ্যগতভাবে সামাজিক রীতি, ভদ্রতা এবং আচার-অনুষ্ঠানের অংশ হিসেবে পানের ব্যবহার চলে আসছে বহু আগে থেকেই। বিশেষ করে খাবারের শেষে একটা পান না খেলে যেন পূর্ণতা আসে না। একটা সময় সমাজে অভিজাত জনগোষ্ঠীর মাঝে পান তৈরি এবং তা সুন্দরভাবে পানদানিতে সাজিয়ে উপস্থাপন লোকজ শিল্প হিসেবে স্থান পেত। Betel leaf with sweet Masala (মিষ্টি পান) বর্তমানে ঢাকাতে পান নতুনভাবে আরো মজাদার উপকরণ ও মসলার সাহায্যে জনপ্রিয়। আজ আমরা তিন বন্ধু @MahabubMunna @RafsanRana এবং আমি পুরাতন ঢাকার নাজিরা বাজার গিয়েছিলাম মিষ্টি পানের স্বাদ নিতে।  A shop of Sweet Betel leaf নাজিরা বাজার এ বেশ কিছু বড় মিষ্টি পানের দোকান রয়েছে। তারমধ্যে একটি হচ্ছে ""দিল্লির শাহী মিঠা পান""। পানের দোকানের সামনে যেতেই চোখ জুড়িয়ে গেল বিভিন্ন আইটেমের রংবেরঙের মসলা দেখে। Colorful Ingredients of 'Sweet betel Leaf' এখানে বাহারি নামের বিভিন্ন রকম পান পাওয়া যায়। তার মধ্যে উল্লেখযোগ্য হচ্ছে-* শাহী মিঠা পান* বেনারসি মিঠা পান* স্পেশাল মাসালা মিঠা পান* দিল্লির শাহী জেলি পান* স্পেশাল আইস পান* স্পেশাল বেনারসি শাহী মিঠা পান* স্পেশাল স্ট্রবেরি পান* স্পেশাল ভ্যানিলা পান* ফায়ার (আগুন) পান* স্পেশাল দিল্লির শাহী ফায়ার পান* দিল্লির শাহী জাফরানি মিঠা পান* স্পেশাল ঢাকার নবাবী পান* স্পেশাল দিল্লির শাহী কস্তুরী পান* লাভ ফর এভার পান, ইত্যাদি।পানের মূল্য: এখানে ১০ টাকা থেকে শুরু করে ১৫০ টাকা মূল্যের পান পাওয়া যায়।আমি ট্রাই করেছি ""স্পেশাল মশলা মিঠা পান""। টেস্ট কেমন ছিল সেটা না হয় না বললাম। আশা করি পুরাতন ঢাকায় যাদের যাতায়াত আছে তারা নিজেরাই গিয়ে ট্রাই করবেন।What is Betel Leaf [Source: Wikipedia]:The betel (Piper betle) is a vine of the family Piperaceae, which includes pepper and kava. Betel leaf is mostly consumed in Asia, and elsewhere in the world by some Asian emigrants, as betel quid or in paan, with Areca nut and/or tobacco.In India and Sri Lanka, a sheaf of betel leaves is traditionally offered as a mark of respect and auspicious beginnings. Occasions include greeting elders at wedding ceremonies, celebrating the New Year, and offering payment to Ayurvedic physicians and astrologers (to whom money and/or areca nut, placed on top of the sheaf of leaves, are offered in thanks for blessings).The betel plant is an evergreen perennial, with glossy heart-shaped leaves and white catkin. The betel plant originated in South and South East Asia.

Embodying their collective energy (Shakti), she is both derivative from the male divinities and the true source of their inner power. She is also greater than any of them. Born fully grown and beautiful, Durga presents a fierce menacing form to her enemies. She is usually depicted riding a lion and with 8 or 10 arms, each holding the special weapon of one of the gods, who gave them to her for her battle against the buffalo demon. Durga-puja, held annually in her honour. selfie with local guides Durga Puja:Durga Puja or Durgatsava is a festival celebrating the worship of the Hindu goddess Durga. Durga puja is prevalent throughout the Hindu society. However, it is one of the most important religious and social festivals in Bengali Hindu society. Durga puja is performed on the dry day of Ashwin or Chaitra month. The Durga Puja of the Ashwin month is known as the Shardiya Durgapuja and the Basanti Durgapuja of the Chaitra month. Shardia Durga Puja is popular. Basanti Durga Puja is largely confined to a few families.Durga Puja is celebrated in the Bangladesh and multiple states of the world, including India and Nepal. However, Durga puja is celebrated with great glory in the states of Bangladesh, West Bengal, Tripura and in Jharkhand due to being the main religious festival of Bengali Hindu society. Durga Puja celebrates the victory of the goddess Durga over the demon king Mahishasura.Durga Puja’s first day is Mahalaya, which heralds the advent of the goddess. Celebrations and worship begin on Sasthi, the sixth day. During the following three days, the goddess is worshipped in her various forms as Durga, Lakshmi, and Sarasvati. The celebrations end with Vijaya Dashami (“Tenth Day of Victory”), when, amid loud chants and drumbeats, idols are carried in huge processions to local rivers, where they are immersed. That custom is symbolic of the departure of the deity to her home and to her husband, Shiva, in the Himalayas. Images of the goddess astride a lion, attacking the demon king Mahishasura are placed at various pandals (elaborately decorated bamboo structures and galleries) and temples. Durga Puja Fair Traditional foods of Durga Puja We The light decoration of the temple Now I want to share a small video with you, in there hope more understand about Durga Puja. Information source:Me, Wikipedia & Britannica Hope you are enjoying my post @Aruni @KatyaL @MahabubMunna

যেহেতু আমাদের কোনো ফান্ড গুগোল দেয়না সেক্ষেত্রে আমরা যে পদ্ধতিতে মিট-আপ গুলো করে থাকি (হিজ হিজ হুজ হুজ) সে পদ্ধতিতেই এ মিট-আপটিও হবে।
খরচ: ১৫০ টাকা (বিকালের নাস্তা ও মিট-আপ আয়োজনের আনুসাঙ্গিক খরচ সহ)

আগামী ২৩ তারিখ কনফারমেশন মেইলের মাধ্যমে যারা সিলেক্টেড হবেন তাদের জানিয়ে দেওয়া হবে।  এছাড়াও যে জিনিষ গুলো সাথে আনতে হবে তা মেইলে দেওয়া থাকবে।

Hi LGs,I'm Biswajit Chakraborty. Core team member of 'Bangladesh Local guides’ as a UI/UX Ninja.Professionally I am a Graphic Designer. Also love to contribute in voluntary community. And I feel Bangladesh local guides is perfect for me to contribute and learn something from there. All of you know that we have completed enjoyably 100th meetup of ‘Bangladesh Local Guides’. Also, many members of BDLG have already posted about that. I do not want to tell about this, I would like to share 'behind the story of the Logo design for 100th meetup'.Yes, you've been able to understand, BDLG 100th meetup logo created by me. That's the logo About two or three months before, we were sat with senior members of the ‘Bangladesh Local Guides’, for discuss about 100th meetup's planning process. On the other discussion the Moderator of BDLG @MahabubMunna  raised the issue of 100th meetup logo, and finally they give me the responsibility to do it, and I feel proud to get the responsibility of making the Logo. From this time I'm thinking what shall I do. Thanks God at least I have done little bit for our 100th meetup. I try to make the logo with* Red-Green Color (Bangladeshi Flag Color)* 100th* Connect* Bangladeshi Culture Our 100th meetup organiser team members had a special page. Where we are discussing everything about the meetup. After creating the logo, I upload it in that page. Then it was very appreciating by the all organiser team members, and it was selected for the 100th meetup. Thank you all ❤️ #100thmeetup #Bangladesh #LocalGuids #BDLG

@AngieYC: I love animals and all the places where I can see them roam freely. If you’re like me, then you’ll enjoy the post “Sajjangarh Biological Park - Paradise for Animal Lovers” by @AnshukMitra. With a great sense of humor, Anshuk introduces us to the many birds, reptiles, wild cats, and other animals that the Sajjangarh Biological Park takes care of. His post is full of amazing photos, interesting facts about the animals and their skin patterns, and of course—a lot of helpful details about the park, like working days, ticket price, and some great tips from Anshuk himself. So if you haven’t seen his post yet, make sure you do!

@InaS: Did you know that June 4 is National Donut Day in the United States and Brazil? @GasparKaren tells us a few curious facts about how the celebration came to be in her post “Donut Day in Brazil and in the World,” which is my favorite this week. Her photos of bright pink, chocolate-covered, fluffy donuts and treats in the shape of whimsical animals are just adorable. For those of you who keep a donut bucket list, you’ll also find Karen’s top three donut shop recommendations in São Paulo that she’s given five-star reviews. Find out more in her post.

@MashaPS: Do you like to explore nature while hiking? I do, and I love to read about other Local Guides’ hiking experiences. This week, I was amazed by the refreshing views in @jayasimha78’s post “Bay Area Hiking Series: Montebello Preserve: White Oaks Trail,” In it, he takes us to the Monte Bello Preserve near Los Altos, CA, USA, and we follow him along the White Oak Trail. It starts from a wheelchair-accessible parking lot and goes up and down lush green hills. If you decide to take this trail, keep in mind what Jay learned: it’s a way-one path that can take a little longer to cover, and it could get chilly under the trees! For more hiking spots in the area, keep an eye on Jay’s profile on Connect, as he’s promised us a whole series of posts.

 Name: Maria or Masha
 Location: Sofia, Bulgaria
 What I love about being a Local Guide: I love how the community feels like one big international family. It’s inspiring to see the constant willingness of fellow Local Guides to help others and keep the information on Google Maps up to date. That motivates me to try sharing more in my contributions and learn from others how to be more helpful.
My favorite thing to explore: In 2020, my family and I changed the focus of our travel adventures. Instead of going to new cities and countries, we started to safely explore the mountains in our home country whenever possible. They quickly became my favorite thing.

 Fun Fact about me: I learn the lyrics of songs by heart unintentionally. I can tell you the first few lines just by hearing the first accords. Unfortunately, though, I’m very bad at singing. I wish I could make better use of that knowledge! 

 
Now it’s your turn! 🙂

Every Friday, Google Moderators highlight the best posts they found to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect.

@MashaPS: I always enjoy reading @AdrianLunsong's posts; they are helpful and a lot of fun. Recently, he shared his experience making soufflé pancakes using a “Quick and easy recipe for Soufflé Pancakes.” Back in Manchester again, Adrian couldn’t wait to research and try a good recipe for this originally Japanese snack, which he first had at The Coffee Code in Malaysia. I loved the sense of humor with which he described his four attempts of preparing the pancakes, all with varying results. Do you like pancakes? Have you tried soufflé pancakes? If not, or you’d like to improve your recipe, make sure to check Adrian’s post for some useful tips. And while you’re there, why not also share with him some of your quick and easy recipes?

@DeniGu: There are a lot of Local Guides who enjoy books as much as they enjoy traveling. That’s why I couldn’t miss the chance to highlight @ChanneLing’s post “Kaohsiung Hidden Gem: The Darkest Bookstore in the World.” It’s ideal for book lovers and for everyone who likes to explore unusual places with unique settings. In it, @ChanneLing leads us inside Wuguan Books in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, a completely dark bookstore where only the books on the shelves and the reading tables are illuminated. Your virtual visit there might inspire you to add Wuguan Books to your bucket list and also join @JordanSB’s fantastic bookshelf challenge. I know I’ll do both!

@BorrisS: This week, I came across @MukulR’s post “গ্রাম্য বাজারের ছেলেবেলার খাবার-My childhood snacks from the village Bazaar,” and I loved it! In it, the Local Guide combines sweetness with nostalgia while presenting the popular snacks his father used to bring from their village bazaar. From peanut and sesame bars to sweet popcorn and more, the post takes you back in time to moments full of sweets and childhood memories. What touched me the most was that I also had the chance to taste several of these treats during my years in Morocco. If you also loved sweet snacks as a kid, then this post is definitely for you!

@KlaudiyaG: 2020 was an unexpected year and for some more than others. In honor of his wife’s memory, @Muhammad_Usman decided to take his kids on a journey filled with great adventures and beautiful sights. He documented his trips and shared them with the community in a series of 14 posts. The final one is called “Phander lake,” which, judging by the photos and story, is a marvelous place in Phander Valley. Surrounded by stunning nature and reflecting the skies in its calm waters, Phander Lake truly is the “jewel” of the valley, as Muhammad says. So don’t miss his post and series!

686131,Review of the Month: Centraĺny by Local Guide Olga Klimchik,62,19.0,"
Caption: A screenshot of Local Guide @OlgaKlimchik’s review of Centraĺny in Minsk, Belarus.
This month, we’re loving Local Guide @OlgaKlimchik’s review of Centraĺny in Minsk, Belarus. It is a supermarket located in a glamorous old building, and Olga tells us about the cafeteria there. What we like about her review is the personal touch and sentiment. 
 
In the review, Olga says:
 
“A legendary supermarket.
 
I mostly go to the cafeteria on the first floor. That is the place where time stands still. The cafeteria has not changed much since the Soviet era; moreover, now it can be called a landmark with Soviet-style stucco moldings, massive chandeliers, like in a theater...
 
The same counters with cheap, delicious cakes (at store prices, not a café’s), juices in plastic cups, and instant tea/coffee in small packages. That is not a café; here, you will not be able to sit and chat in silence. But if you need a quick bite and move on, that's the place you need.
 
One may eat a cake with juice on the counter by the window, gaze at the avenue, at passers-by, take a short break... those are special moments... and plunge further into the daily rush. In addition to the high counter, several tables have appeared nowadays. But still, this is not a place where it will be cozy to sit and chat. It has another charm.”
 
Olga managed to recreate the unique atmosphere of the place from her perspective and experience. She gives useful information about what to expect at the cafeteria in terms of seating, prices, food and beverages, and how to make the most of your visit. She has also shared photos of the delicious desserts on display and the interior.
You can read the full review here.
 
How do we select the Review of the Month?
The Local Guides Review of the Month is chosen based on a variety of criteria. We look for genuine, helpful reviews that include quality details about interesting places. Featured photos and reviews are taken by actual Local Guides around the world who have uploaded them to places on Google Maps.

686131,Какая книга прочитанная вами вдохновила вас посетить то или иное место?,101,11.0,"
Быть мамой двоих детей может быть немного утомительно, поэтому в последние несколько лет я начала давать своему мозгу отдых, читая легких книг. Я стала искать спокойных, не совсем драматических рассказах о людях и местах, в которых я никогда не была. Так я обнаружила изрядное количество романов об Италии. Одни из них - любовные истории; другие говорят о новых начинаниях; некоторые больше похожи на путеводителей. Действие некоторых книг происходит в самых красивых и завораживающих местах Италии.
 
Кофе и Италия - это две из моих любимых вещей. Поэтому, когда я нашла книги Диего Галдино “Утренний кофе в Риме” и “Вечерний кофе в Риме”, я не подумала дважды, а сразу их купила. Представьте себе: Италия, кофе, книги! Это те мелочи, которые делают меня счастливой.
 
Надпись: фотография двух книг “Утренний кофе в Риме” и “Вечерний кофе в Риме” на кофейном столике. (Местный эксперт @MashaPS)
История довольно обычная. Владелец кофейни, с детства посвятивший свою жизнь своему каффе, встречает женщину. В этих книгах меня захватывала не та романтика. Меня впечатлила любовь героя к своему родному городу Риму, площадь, где находился его бар, и его привязанность к постоянным клиентам, которые стали его семьей. Я была очарована местами в Риме, которые он посещал по своему настроению. Так что я тоже начала мечтать увидеть их в реальной жизни, и у меня появился шанс в 2018 году.
 
Одно из этих мест куда он ведет свою девушку из второй книги это был Пантеон. Как обычный турист, у меня не было возможности увидеть его таким пустым, как они, но он был даже более впечатляющим, чем его описание в романе и в моём воображении.
 
Надпись: Фотография Пантеона в Риме в пасмурный день, перед которым гуляет множество людей. (Местный эксперт @MashaPS)
Оказавшись в Риме, я не остановилась только на местах из книг, особенно потому, что была не одна. Вот почему в мой маршрут были включены и некоторые из книжных мест моего мужа. С тех пор, как он прочитал “Ангелы и демоны” Дэна Брауна и “Код да Винчи”, он захотел увидеть Сады Ватикана. Он был очень разочарован, когда мы поняли, что туристам не разрешается свободно гулять по этому красивому месту, что является важной частью романов. Тем не менее, мы не могли пропустить посещение музеев Ватикана, где мы увидели некоторые из величайших произведений искусства эпохи Возрождения и т.д.. У нас была возможность рассмотреть шедевры Микеланджело, Караваджо, Рафаэля и затаили дыхание при входе в Сикстинскую капеллу.
 
Надпись: Фотография потолка Сикстинской капеллы. (Местный эксперт @MashaPS)
Прогуливаясь по улицам Рима, я чувствовала, как меня окружает история. Неважно то, бросала ли я монеты в фонтан Треви, ела мороженое на Испанской лестнице, представляла себе битвы гладиаторов в Колизее или просто искала кусок пиццы на узких римских улочках.
 
Надпись: Фотография освещенного фонтана Треви ночью. (Местный эксперт @MashaPS)
 
А вы когда-нибудь посещали какое-либо место из-за прочитанной книги? Что это было за произведение и где были эти места? Поделитесь своими историями в комментариях ниже.

@MashaPS: When I was a kid, my grandparents used to tell me a saying when I didn’t want to finish my breakfast. They said, “Eat your breakfast by yourself, share your lunch with a friend, give your dinner to your enemy,” meaning that breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Now, as a grown-up, I know that a good breakfast gives you energy. In her post “Never Skip Breakfast Again With This Simple and Tasty Recipe,” @SilviaMontoyaGomez shares an easy yet delicious breakfast recipe of zucchini scramble with tomatoes and basil. What impressed me the most about her post was feeling like I was in a cooking class with her. Silvia explains the preparation process step by step while providing helpful photos. If you haven't read her post yet, make sure you do so, and maybe even try her suggestion for your next breakfast. Feel free to browse more recipes from the #CommunityChefChallenge here.

@KlaudiyaG: This year was tough on many of us, but, as the wise wizard Dumbledore says in one of the “Harry Potter” books,  ""Happiness can be found, even in the darkest of times, if one only remembers to turn on the light."" This quote captures the essence of @Melissa_Langlois’s post, ""My new big family - the local guides #CommunityLoveChallenge.” In it, she shares her story as a Local Guide, a healthcare professional, and a person during the pandemic. Melissa tells us how the Local Guides community gave her strength and courage to continue doing what she’s doing. Her post is a beautiful recap of her experiences in 2020.
 
Caption: A photo showcasing a variety of pastries on display at the Tiong Bahru Bakery in Singapore. (Local Guide @Lusianaa)
@BorrisS: This week, I came across @Lusianaa’s post, “Croissant and Concert #CommunityFoodFightChallenge,” and I enjoyed it a lot. In it, she remembers a trip to Singapore she did with her sister back in January 2020. Although the main reason for the trip was attending a music concert, she tells us about her memorable visit to the Tiong Bahru Bakery. If you love French pastries and croissants as much as Lusiana and me, then this post is definitely for you. It will give you a glimpse inside what she says is “one of the best bakeries in Singapore!”

@DeniGu: As part of his #monthlytopic for November, @HiroyukiTakisawa took us to the Salad Farm in Hachimantai, Japan, with his post, “Let's go to meet bunnies and alpacas! , #monthlytopic - A place to meet animals‌‌🐾.” Apart from the delicious locally produced food and lunch boxes on offer, the farm is also famous for its petting zoo. Hiroyuki melts our hearts with adorable photos of fluffy and friendly-looking alpacas and hopping bunnies. If you’re feeling down, I guarantee his post will brighten your day!

@Giu_DiB: Connect is always a source of wonder for me, as I constantly discover new places, delicious recipes, or beautiful traditions from countries on the other side of the world. This week, I was amazed by @OlavHelland’s curious photographic quest, “Chasing Hermes.” Olav shares stunning pictures of statues of the Greek god Hermes, also known as Mercury in Roman mythology, which he has found around his hometown Oslo. Whether you are into European culture and want to learn more about this deity, or you love photography and want to see some great photos of Norwegian monuments and statues, you will enjoy this post. 
 
Caption: A photo taken inside the Navy Pier in Chicago, with a big blue sign that reads “Navy Pier” under a glass roof. (Local Guide @Tushar_Suradkar)
@MashaPS: I love to read travel stories by Local Guides where I get to experience destinations through their eyes and memories. The post that transported me across the world this week is @Tushar_Suradkar’s “Navy Pier in Chicago - Where Fun Lives Large.” In it, he first takes us on a walk outside the building of the Navy Pier, where we can enjoy a moment of serenity watching the boats go by or the lights come up on the mesmerizing Chicago cityscape. There are also plenty of things to see and do inside, such as shopping, having a meal, and more. I found it impressive that there is even a museum and a botanical garden, which are open to the public free of charge! Tushar also makes a point to list the accessibility features of the place. If Chicago is on your bucket list, make sure to check out this post for some more recommendations.

@LilyanaZ: When visiting another country, some people like to try unique delicacies from the local cuisine. As always, @Sophia_20 is here to give us some helpful recommendations, this time about food. In her post, “Some special food around Cambodia,” she introduces not only commonly found dishes in Cambodia but also some not so well-known and region-specific specialties to add to your foodie’s list. Check out her mouth-watering pictures, and you might find something you want to try in Cambodia one day.

@DeniGu: If you live in a bustling city, sometimes all you need is a little peaceful getaway. @Zino_ takes us on one such getaway in her post “#monthlytopic of October 2020 - A Quiet Place in Kuje, Nigeria.” Her vivid photos of green fields and mountains, traditional huts, and adorable animals perfectly illustrate the calmness of the Almat Farms in Kuje, Nigeria. Whether you prefer an active or a relaxing holiday, this place has something for everyone with its variety of activities and facilities. It’s also ideal for kids, just like the kids-friendly locations in the nearby capital of Abuja, which @Zino_ has curated into a helpful Google Maps list. So, if you need a moment of tranquility, head to her post, or check the other #monthlytopic posts for October 2020.

@MashaPS: This week, the photos in @Anonymous’s post, “Landschaften und Städte am Fluß Inn, Teil 2,” took my breath away. The Local Guide introduces us to a few stunning places along the Inn River that he visited in the second half of his bicycle tour from Passau in Germany to Innsbruck in Austria. While reading the post, you will be immersed in the beauty of Rattenberg and its lively pedestrian zone. You will sit on the river bank and gaze at the mountains in Schwaz, and maybe feel like a noble person looking at the photo of the Mitterhardt Castle. @Anonymous’s story continues with some amazing places to see in Hall in Tirol and Innsbruck. If you like this post, make sure to check out the first part of his bicycle journey as well.

@BorrisS: As a big foodie and a fan of Indian cuisine, I loved @Saurabhtheexplorer’s post, “My Favourite Food at Vrindavan.” It is a detailed description of the Local Guide’s favorite snacks and drinks in the city of Vrindavan, India. From lassi to tea and from samosas to sweets, we are introduced to a world of various tastes and scents. The photos and narrative made me feel like I was wrapped in different aromas, such as curry and cinnamon. If you are like me and you love to eat and discover new flavors, this post is definitely for you!

@TsekoV: As the summer season reaches its peak in the Northern Hemisphere, several Local Guides in Italy enjoyed some time in nature. In the post, “Flowers, a joy to share with friends,” @LuigiZ shares his joy of attending @manulele81’s meet-up, the first meet-up of Italian Local Guides after the lockdown. They had a 10-kilometer photo walk and a picnic in the region of Castelluccio di Norcia, while observing the social distancing rules. Nature-lovers, don’t miss reading Luigi’s post.

@Bobiisha: This week, I stumbled upon the post “Botanical garden of Wellington” by @Sophia_20. In it, she shows us some colorful photos of the plants at the Wellington Botanic Garden in New Zealand that she had captured during different seasons. I liked her post also because of the useful information and tips that she shared about the place. You will learn about the different sections within the garden, how to access it, and more.

@MoniV: Have you ever been to Croatia? If not and you’re planning a holiday, then you should read @Tomislav_CRO's post “Croatia - Where to Go?.” In this post, you’ll find many wonderful photos and tips on what places to visit depending on your travel preferences. There are a variety of suggestions on where to go if you’re a foodie, if you want to have some fun, or if you’re interested in history. I’m sure you will enjoy this amazing post.

@MashaPS: Italy has always attracted me like a magnet. I admire the must-visit famous landmarks, but I want to feel the spirit of the place by mixing with the locals and visiting the spots they do. In his recent post, “Antiques street market in Treviglio, how to spend a few hours surrounded by curiosities!,” @RiccyB introduces one such place. He tells us about a street market in Treviglio (a town close to Milan) which takes place every third Sunday of the month. He mentions different valuable and interesting objects that you can find there and shares some great photos. If you wish to feel like a local or simply love antiques, make sure to read this post.

@AlexaAC: Many of us love to travel, so this week I want to highlight @mhcouette's post 10 tips to travel more responsibly!” In it, she shares a short video with tips on what we can do to be more conscious when travelling and have a positive impact on the countries we visit. She gives advice on what to consider before, during, and after the journey.

@sonnyNg: What is one of the best ways to learn about history? This week, I came across the interesting post “Discovering history in Italy: Ancient Egypt” by @LuigiZ. In it, he shares the curious background story of the Egyptian Museum in Torino, Italy, as well as useful tips for your visit there. Luigi has also captured on camera some of the amazing exhibits. His post is a great guide for first-time visitors.

686131,"Friday Favorites: life-saving lists, a sourdough bread tutorial, costumed dogs, and more",174,35.0,"
Every Friday, Googlers round up some of the best posts they came across during the week to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. This week, life-saving lists, a sourdough bread tutorial, costumed dogs, and more.
@MashaPS: While browsing through Connect this week, I came upon an amazing post, “Saving Lives with Lists,” written by Local Guide @Kwiksatik. This is her first post in a series that aims to show how Google Maps lists can be used in health-related emergency situations. In it, she shares that she has epilepsy and tells us about the effects of this condition. Megan has found that she can use lists to put together all the necessary information, like doctors’ offices and personal contacts of a family member, in case of emergency. Her post is full of courage, empathy, and consideration for others. I’m looking forward to reading her next post!
 
Caption: A photo of Megan smiling at a camera while doing an electroencephalogram test, with electrodes placed on her head. (Local Guide @Kwiksatik)
@TsekoV: My pick for this week is @Avraham_Jurado's post “How I make sourdough bread,” a great way to celebrate World Bread Day with a very interesting step-by-step tutorial. I liked it a lot because bread is often overlooked both as a dish and as a topic for foodies, but it’s one of the most important foods in many cultures. With this post we can all learn more about this traditional preparation, and with some imagination, we can even smell the scent of those two beautiful loaves. I think I'll actually follow the instructions and try myself at home during the weekend. If you want to make it too, you should definitely take a look at this post first.

@VasT : A post that caught my attention this week was the Kids friendly Malaga, Spain, by @KseniaM. Planning the perfect holidays can be challenging, especially when you have children. @KseniaM shared her experience while visiting Malaga, Spain. In her post, she talks about some of her favorite spots, like the Interactive Music Museum, where you and your children can spend a joyful day while learning about music. Do you wish to learn more? Go and have a look at her post!

@AlexaAC: I found it rather meaningful that @IgorVats’s post, Barbos Cup, shows the celebration of adopted dogs that find forever homes.  I really enjoyed the colourful costumes their owners created showing the younger generation that all animals deserve love and respect.

686131,"Friday Favorites: Notre-Dame, things to do in Rotterdam, and more",320,29.0,"
Every Friday, Googlers round up some of the best posts they came across during the week to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. This week, Notre-Dame, things to do in Rotterdam, and more.
@MashaPS: This week, I discovered and enjoyed reading a travel post titled [Netherlands] One Day in Rotterdam : Things To Do.” In it, @SunPanupong shares helpful information about how to organize your trip to Rotterdam if you happen to be there just for a day. He included his personal experience traveling there along with Google Maps links, useful websites, and the hours for all the places described in the post. @SunPanupong chose a few excellent places for us to explore, such as Rotterdam Centraal and Market Hall / Markthal. But the one that impressed me most are the strange yellow houses—Cube Houses / Kijk-Kubus. Be sure to check out this post to learn more about great places to go around this city in The Netherlands.
 
Caption: A photo of the tops of Cube Houses in Rotterdam captured from the ground. The yellow houses form a geometric shape resemble a star, colored by the blue sky with a few white clouds. (Local Guide @SunPanupong)
@MoniDi: While I was going through this week’s posts, I couldn’t help but notice A Love Letter to Notre-Dame Cathedral in Paris” by @AshleySundquist . She presented the beautiful Parisian cathedral in the form of a letter addressed to it. That immediately caught my attention and it made me want to visit the French capital once again. The unusual way the post is written made it my favourite. If you want to learn some interesting facts about Notre-Dame Cathedral, don’t miss this post!
 
Caption: A black and white photo of a blonde woman facing the Notre-Dame Cathedral. She is holding an orange hat which is the only part of the photo that’s shown in color. (Local Guide @AshleySundquist)
@DanniS: Reading @turaibalazs’s “Exploring the culture of Madrid - within a distance of a metro stop” brought back memories of when I was in Madrid a long time ago. It’s nice to see a different point of view and explore new things. The author shows a great variety of the city’s culture and history and even includes helpful navigation tips. Just as the post states, the capital offers a bit of everything and you can see the art, culture, and history all around you.

@VitB: I love watching the sunset over the sea and if you like that too, I recommend you check my favorite post from this week: The Most Iconic Sunset Spot in Galle, Sri Lanka” written by @bDilshan95. The place is located at the southwest coast of Sri Lanka and it is not only a  popular sunset place but also one of the main tourist's attractions because of the Galle Dutch Fort. I really like that @bDilshan95 included a recommendation on the best time to visit and two great photos.

686131,Introduce Yourself - January 2019,239,448.0,"
Hello everyone! Welcome to Local Guides Connect. Please take a moment to introduce yourself to our community.
 
As “Introduce Yourself” threads can be lengthy, we start a new one each month and lock past threads. You can check past threads, like December's, to see who recently joined and where they’re from (simply search for ""Introduce Yourself""). If you're new, please use this thread to post your “I'm new” or “Hello world” posts. We’ll merge any posts we find elsewhere with this thread to keep things organized.
 
It’s a pleasure for me to start this year’s Introduce Yourself topics.
 
Caption: A photo of Local Guide MashaPS watching the Tiber River in Rome, Italy, with a Castle St. Angelo in a background. (V. Spasov)

Name: Maria
Location: Sofia, Bulgaria
What I love about being a Local Guide: Since I joined the Local Guides program, I am impressed with how people here are keen on helping each other. When I am choosing a new place to visit, I prefer to read reviews written by Local Guides from all around the world. Also, I am trying to be as useful to other Local Guides, by sharing my opinions and photos, as they were for me.
My favorite thing to explore: I love to travel a lot. Before each trip, I always explore the place on Google Maps. I am doing this so closely and carefully, that when I finally arrive at the place itself, it seems to me like I’ve already been there. With two little kids, it is a little bit harder to travel as freely and impulsively as I'd love. But when I have a chance to explore new places, I prefer doing this as a local. 
Fun Fact about me: People who know me are aware that I am a coffee fan. I simply love good coffee. That is why when I travel, one of the first things I do is search and try the local coffee drinks.

686131,3 красивых мест для посещения в Ялтинском регионе,133,37.0,"
Надпись: Фотография экстерьера Ливадийского дворца с его белым фасадом. Широкая дорога ведет к главному входу между двумя зелеными лужайками. (Местный Эксперт @MashaPS)Я родилась и выросла в Болгарии, но половина моей семьи из России. Сейчас они живут на Крымском полуострове, и мне достаточно повезло посетить это место много раз. Сегодня я хочу поделиться некоторыми из моих любимых мест в Ялтинском регионе. Для меня Крымский полуостров это удивительное сочетание естественной красоты и место исторического значения, с архитектурными следами жизни разных народов, с его синими побережьями купающимися в двумя морями (Черным и Азовском), и прохладными горными вершинами. Здесь Вы можете загорать на берегу моря утром и подняться на гору во второй половине дня.
 
Итак, вот мои лучшие три места для посещения в Ялтинском регионе на Крымском полуострове.
 
1. Ливадийский дворец
 
Надпись: Фотография внутреннего Итальянского сада Ливадийского дворца. Белый внешний коридор окружает зеленые кусты и высокие пальмы. (Местный Эксперт @MashaPS)
Когда речь идет об истории, одним из самых впечатляющих зданий для меня является Ливадийский дворец. Этот белоснежный дворец раньше был летним домом последнего российского императора Николая II и его семьи. Он был построен в стиле Итальянского Ренессанса, а Вы можете наслаждаться захватывающим видом на Черное море через его окна. Если для вас недостаточно этой красоты, прогуляйтесь по великолепным зеленым паркам, окружающих дворца, или сядьте и отдохните в одном из уютных внутренних садов.
 
Надпись: Фотография комнаты совета в Ливадийском дворце с огражденным круглым столом с белой скатертью. На столе - золотые таблички с названиями, окружен деревянными стульями. Черчилль, Рузвельт и Сталин сидели за этим столом во время Ялтинской конференции 1945 года. (Местный Эксперт @MashaPS)
Один интересный факт о Ливадийском дворце заключается в том, что в 1945 году он был одним из трех дворцов, где проходила знаменитая Ялтинская конференция. Во время этой конференции обсуждались заключительные этапы Второй мировой войны. Каждый раз, когда я посещаю это место, я чувствую себя частью истории, зная, что важные фигуры, такие как президент Франклин Д. Рузвельт, премьер-министр Уинстон Черчилль и премьер-министр Джозеф Сталин, шли по этим же залам.
 
2. Ласточкино гнездо
 
Надпись: Фотография замка Ласточкино гнездо на вершине скале Авроры, с видом на Черное море. (Местный Эксперт @MashaPS)
Ласточкино гнездо выглядит как сказочный замок, расположенный на вершине скалы Авроры высотой 40 метров, прямо с видом на Черное море. Иногда у меня такое впечатление, что он может упасть в воду. Замок является символом Южного побережья Крымского полуострова , так что вам будет трудно найти сувенир без его изображения.
 
Есть много легенд и историй о Ласточкином гнезде, которые местные жители рассказывают по сей день. Моя любимая, это о любви Морского бога Посейдона к Авроре, богине рассвета. Согласно этой легенде, Аврора каждое утро стояла на краю скалы, ожидая, когда первый луч солнца коснется ее лица. Это было знаком того, что в этом мире начался новый день. Увидев однажды Аврору, Посейдон влюбился в нее. Зная что их любовь невозможна, он решил заколдовать ее. Его план состоял в том, что поставить волшебную тиару на ее голову, пока она спит. Однако, тиара упала с рук Посейдона на камень, и ее бриллиант разбился маленькими кристалликами. Один из тех кусков закатился в трещину скалы, первый солнечный луч упал на него, и яркий свет вспыхнул. Внезапно появился замок Ласточкино гнездо. Он по-прежнему стоит и сегодня на этой скале как символ любви.
 
Это всего лишь одна из многих историй, рассказывающих о Ласточкином гнезде. Если вы посетите это место, расскажите мне, какую историю вы слышали и полюбили больше всего. Но я уверена, что вы согласитесь со мной об одном: это место великолепное!
3. Гора Ай Петри
 
Надпись: Фотография одного из холмов горы Ай-Петри, с фотографирующими людьми, на безопасных рельсах. На вершине холма есть пышные зеленые деревья и поля. Больше горных склонов можно увидеть вдали, с Ялтой и Черным морем, которые видны у подножия. (Местный Эксперт Светлана Б)
Так как речь идет о заколдованных мест, гора Ай Петри является обязательным визитом. Для меня эта гора выглядит как замок с высокими каменными стенами, с многими крутыми склонами, напоминающие зубцы, и турель-подобными острыми скальными образованиями, возвышающиеся высоко в облаках. Вы все еще рядом с Ялтой, рядом с Черным морем, хотя кажется, что вы вошли в волшебный мир. Если вы хотите достичь высоты горы Ай Петри, я рекомендую вам сделать это на канатной дороге.
 
Вы были в Ялтинском регионе? Каковы ваши любимые места там? Расскажите нам в комментариях ниже.

686131,"Friday Favorites: Russian handicrafts, a #LooReview meetup, and more",79,24.0,"
Every Friday, Googlers round up some of the best posts they came across during the week to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. This week, Russian handicrafts, a #LooReview meetup, and more.
@MashaPS: This week, I was intrigued by the warm and bright colors from the photos @INGA1 shared in her post,“Russian national handicrafts.” She presents us some of the most famous and significant Russian national handicrafts including, Palekh miniature painting, Khokhloma Gold painting, and Valenki.  Can you imagine that these elegant, handcrafted pieces can be used in everyday life? Of course, she also included the most popular symbol of Russia—the Matryushka wooden doll. In her post, @INGA1 conveyed the Russian spirit with amazing photos of these handicrafts. This post caught my attention because it reminds me of my childhood.
Caption: A photo of a table filled with Russian handcrafted objects including intricately painted boxes, Russian dolls, jars, and more. (Local Guide @INGA1)
@AngieYC: If you like diving and the beauty of what’s under the sea, I think the post “Underwater Misool, Raja Ampat” written by @Lera76 will make you want to pack your bags and visit Raja Ampat. He briefly shared what to expect when you go underwater and you can clearly see how beautiful it is from his pictures. This island in Indonesia is one of the most famous for their crystal clear water and is often visited by expert divers from all over the world. 
@NadyaPN: Are you ever curious about what’s behind a closed door? Local Guide @Potsdamomente sure is—and loves to take photos of them as a result. In her post “Why I love doors and how I take photos of them,” she shares four tips for taking great photos of doors! “The more doors I find, the more I find myself looking for small details that could hint at what lies behind a door,” she wrote in her post. Be sure to check out her tips and share your amazing entrance photos in the comments below. 
Caption: A photo of an entrance to a red building with brick steps and a bright, blue door with a floral wreath hung on it. There are potted plants on and around the steps. Above the door is the number “24” and a sculpture of a child running. (Local Guide @Potsdamomente)
@DeniGu: I’ve always admired the efforts and endless positivity of Local Guides who dedicate their time to doing something good. From clean-the-world campaigns, to meet-ups for mapping the accessibility features of an area, there are a few ongoing great initiatives I’m sure you’ve read about on Connect—or even took part in! That’s why my pick for this week is @Nand_Kishore's “[RECAP] Let's Map Public Toilets Mumbai.” Together with two other Local Guides, @Nand_Kishore joined the Swachh Bharat Mission in India, leaving #LooReviews and contributing photos and edits of public toilets on Google Maps. Take a moment and find inspiration in his post, where he shared in great details where they went, what they did, and how this experience influenced their perception of the public toilet situation in Mumbai.

Caption: A photo of the clear waters at Kelingking Beach on Penida Island off the coast of Bali, Indonesia. (Local Guide @indahnuria)
@AngieYC: Local Guide @indahnuria is a diving enthusiast who loves the sea and ocean. She recently shared a great post, “For the Love of the Ocean,” in honor of World Ocean Day. Although the global celebration was on June 8, Indah feels that every day is Ocean Day for her. In the post, she shares her experience with the ocean from early childhood in Indonesia to adulthood in different countries. She teaches her children to love and protect the ocean, too! But Indah is worried about the future. That’s why she takes part in many awareness initiatives and gives us simple tips on how to keep the waters clean. Find out what they are in her post.
 
Caption: A photo of the Whitstable port with the rainbow flag flying in the sea breeze. (Local Guide @HeyitsNicho)
@InaS: My favorite post this week is “A day out to Whitstable” by @HeyitsNicho. In it, the Local Guide tells us about a one-day trip to Whitstable, a seaside town in southern England. The smell of the sea, the bright sunshine, and a lovely boat ride made this a fun day out. They discovered great places to have a drink and grab delicious fish and chips to enjoy by the sea. Whitstable seems like a colorful town to explore—and it flies the rainbow flag, too! So, if you’re looking for quick getaway ideas for your bucket list, don't miss @HeyitsNicho’s post. There’s a lot to see.
 
Caption: A photo of limestone rock formations at the El Torcal de Antequera natural reserve in Spain. (Local Guide @MariaJoseBlazquez)
@BorrisS: I found @MariaJoseBlazquez's post “El Torcal de Antequera: Un mar de formas erosionadas en la roca…” delightful. It’s about the Local Guide’s visit to the El Torcal de Antequera natural reserve in Spain. The place is famous for its limestone rocks and their curious shapes, and we can see how beautiful they are in Maria’s amazing photos. Some formations have names like “The Sphinx” and “The Screw,” but they remind Maria of fantasy worlds and pancakes! Her post also includes facts about the area and the hiking trails it offers and helpful information about her camera settings. If you’re someone who loves rocky sceneries and photography, then this post is for you.

3. What I love about being a Local Guide: When it comes to the community, what strikes me the most is the diversity. I learn a lot from the Local Guides on Connect and Google Maps: from culture to hidden gems and food, to different tips, and more. This community really opened my eyes to how big and wonderful our world is, and I’m very proud to be a part of it!
4. My favorite thing to explore: I love cafes and restaurants and everything related to food! Wherever I go, I open Google Maps and explore the best places to grab a bite around me.

5. Fun Fact about me: I’m allergic to chocolate, but I don’t have a sweet tooth anyway, so that’s fine with me! I prefer savory meals and snacks. There are only a handful of desserts I like, like carrot cake and lemon tart, and, of course, boba tea.

Every Friday, Google Moderators highlight the best posts they found to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. These are posts detailing past experiences that we hope will serve as entertainment and inspiration for your future bucket list. This week, a lake in Indonesia, Karina’s coffee truck, and more.
 
Caption: A scenic photo of Tanjung Sarai Lake surrounded by greenery in East Kalimantan, Indonesia. (Local Guide @SetyawatiAnik)
@AngieYC: The post “Tanjung Sarai, Wisata Baru” by @SetyawatiAnik captured my imagination. It introduces a hidden gem from Indonesia, Tanjung Sarai Lake in East Kalimantan, which is three hours away from where the Local Guide lives, but, as she says, worth the drive. It’s easy to imagine the pristine forests and beautiful lake, dotted with islands, that @SetyawatiAnik describes thanks to her breathtaking photos. Among all else, she gives helpful details about the place, like the free entry and that it’s perfect for families and friends. If you wish to visit the Tanjung Sarai Lake, too, check out her post.

@DeniGu: For some 70 weeks now, the One Accessibility team has shared educational, inspirational, and moving content about different aspects of accessibility. The series is called Accessibility Uncovered, and one of their latest posts is @Jesi’s “❤️ My Favorite Accessible ♿️ Place.” Jesi tells us about the Recoleta Cultural Center in Buenos Aires that is not just her favorite accessible place but her favorite place in general. With its wide ramps that start from the entrance and connect each floor, exciting exhibitions, and multiple activity areas, it’s easy to see why the center ranks so high in Jesi’s list. Explore its unique features in her post.

@Bobiisha: The story that touched me the most this week was “Karina coffee truck” by Local Guide @Niv1234. I loved not only the cheerful photos but also the warm and personal way in which Niv talks about Karina and her newly opened small business. Her story is one of bravery: she opened her coffee truck to visitors a few months ago, and despite the ongoing global pandemic, her positive attitude and welcoming approach have drawn people to try her amazing coffee and fresh snacks. Many come back again and even bring their friends! I think this is a great example of how positivity and creativity can make good things happen and how Local Guides can help spread the word. Read more about Karina in Niv’s post.

@Giu_DiB: This week, I really enjoyed reading about @Velvel’s visit to a Turkish cafe in Indonesia. In her post “Experiencing Turkey in Jakarta,” she shares her tasty experience at the Mardin Fine Baklava Cafe, including generous details about the place, useful health-related information, and beautiful photos of the venue and the traditional food she tried. She also recorded a nice video of the making process of Ottoman and Turkish sand coffee and the variety of baklava offered at the cafe. That is the perfect post for foodies interested in knowing more about some of the best Turkish culinary traditions.

Caption: An illustration of Local Guides looking at a Local Guides Connect page.
We know that every Local Guide is passionate about something, whether it’s ways to improve accessibility, photography tips, or staying in the know about the latest Local Guides and Google Maps updates. To give you the opportunity to easily discover the content you care about the most on Connect, we’re launching a new feature, Search Subscriptions. By enabling this option in your settings page — and adding in keywords you would like to hear about —  you will receive an email notification every time another Local Guide writes about a topic important to you.
 
Follow these steps to set up your search subscriptions:

Go to My settings and select Advanced Settings;
Click on the Subscriptions & Notifications tab and then on Search Subscriptions;
In the ‘Search query’ field (see image below), type up to five keywords;
Click Save.

Caption: A screenshot of the My Settings page that shows the ‘Search query’ field under the Subscriptions & Notifications and Search Subscriptions tabs, which have red rectangles around them.
 To make the most out of this feature, here are a few tips on selecting and inserting your keywords:

Use single words and not phrases. For example, write “features” instead of “Google Maps features.”
Make it specific. If you’re a foodie, don’t just write “food,” but think of your favorite dish, like “ramen” or “tacos,” and use it. 
Separate each keyword with a comma.
Avoid extra spaces. Be careful not to add a space before the first keyword or double space after the comma because you won’t be able to save your preferences.
Insert up to five keywords to ensure that you receive only relevant information. Adding more words may lead to unnecessary notifications.
You can write keywords in any of the 33 languages supported on Connect, apart from English, and also mix different languages.

 
One more thing: for more control over the notifications you receive, you can define the scope of the keyword search. Simply navigate to Notification Settings, the tab next to Search Subscriptions, and click on the dropdown menu shown in the image below. You can choose to be notified when your keywords appear in: 

Posts only: includes post title and text; or 
Posts and Replies: includes post title and text and the comments below it.

Caption: A screenshot of the My Settings page that shows the dropdown menu next to ‘For my search subscriptions, notify me for’ under the Subscriptions & Notifications and Notification Settings tabs, which have red rectangles around them.
What keywords will you subscribe to? Let us know in the comments below.

@Giu_DiB: Being a Local Guide means helping people make the best decisions about the things worth doing. It also gives us the opportunity to help small businesses in challenging times, and it’s amazing to see how committed Local Guides are to their local communities. @MukulR recently shared a very uplifting story in the third episode of his small business series, “Supporting small business: Part 3.” If you want to learn about how a married couple keeps their business going during a pandemic and how we as Local Guides can play an important role for families like theirs, make sure to read this heartwarming article.

@InaS: My favorite post this week was “Our responsibilities to the people who are suffering due to cold wave” by @PavelSarwar who tells us about one of his volunteering projects. Together with Local Guides @SumaiyaZafrin and @RadiaRayanC, they distributed winter clothes and new blankets among low-income families in Bangladesh door to door. They are also planning to reach even more areas in the country. That is not their first initiative in their community; they have also distributed sanitary pads to those who need them.

@TsekoV: Do you love snowy winters as much as I do? If yes, then you shouldn’t miss the post “Winter Getaway to Traverse City – Igloo Dining & More!” by @Sheetal_RS. In it, you will find yourself on a stunning getaway to Traverse City in the U.S. state of Michigan, where you can enjoy an outdoor dining experience in... igloos! I haven’t seen such igloos before, but I love the idea behind them. According to Sheetal, the brewery that owns the igloos offers contact-free service and allows up to six people inside. Another attraction close to Traverse City is the snow-covered sand dunes. Are you curious to find out more? Check out Sheetal’s post.

@AngieYC: The scenery and setting in @Sophia_20’s post “Leavenworth, a dazzling German village in Washington [USA]” captured my attention with its snow-capped peaks and festive decorations. I really enjoyed reading about Leavenworth, a village in Washington State that offers all kinds of adventure and hobby activities. Sophia helpfully shared a list of the usual cultural events there throughout the year, and it seems that Leavenworth is a great place to add to your bucket list. There is something happening every month!

696834,Local Pride Foods: Dua makanan kebanggan lokal Indonesia,163,64.0,"
Indonesia memiliki banyak makanan khas daerah yang luar biasa, tetapi sayangnya kita tidak bisa membawanya saat kita berada di luar negeri. Namun, saat ini sudah banyak makanan dalam kemasan yang “travel-friendly”.
 
Sebagai orang Indonesia ada dua makanan lokal yang saya rasa cukup kita banggakan dan saya yakin banyak dari kita yang membawanya saat kita travelling, baik itu untuk liburan ataupun karena kita tinggal di luar negeri. Makanan tersebut adalah Indomie dan BonCabe. 
 
Jadi, apakah makanan tersebut dan mengapa kita sangat menyukainya?
 
Indomie
 
Keterangan: Foto empat bungkus mie instan Indomie dengan rasa yang berbeda. (Local Guide @AngieYC)
Meskipun kamu bukan dari Indonesia, kamu mungkin pernah mendengar, melihat atau bahkan mencoba Indomie. Indomie adalah salah satu merek mie instan. Mereka memiliki dua varian, mie kuah dan mie goreng. Tetapi yang lebih terkenal adalah varian Mi Gorengnya, karena varian ini cukup populer juga di negara lain.
 
Keterangan: Foto mie goreng Indomie yang sudah dimasak di dalam mangkuk dengan bawang goreng diatasnya. (Local Guide @AngieYC)
Saya rasa Indomie dapat disebut sebagai sebuah “delicacy”, terutama bagi orang Indonesia yang sudah menikmatinya sejak kecil. Ya, ini bukan makanan yang paling sehat, namun kita dapat selalu membuatnya lebih sempurna lagi. Berikut adalah cara yang diajarkan Ibu saya:
 

Rebus mie dan tiriskan setelah mie-nya matang.
Taruh sedikit minyak kedalam wajan, masukkan mie yang sudah matang dan bumbu Indomie dari kemasannya. 
Aduk hingga bumbu merata pada mie, kemudian letakkan semuanya diatas piring atau mangkuk. Jangan ragu untuk menambahkan sayuran apa saja yang kamu mau di tahap ini. 
Goreng telur, letakkan di atas mie dan mie goreng sudah siap untuk disantap.

 
Indomie memiliki berbagai jenis rasa untuk kedua varian kuah dan goreng mereka; dari rasa rendang, sate, hingga sambal matah, kari dan masih banyak lagi. Rasa favorit saya adalah Mie goreng original, rendang dan sambal matah. 
 
Fun fact: Tahukah anda bahwa ada lebih dari 80 rasa Indomie yang tersedia di luar Indonesia dan lebih dari 100 rasa di dalam negeri? Jadi, jika kamu menemukan merek ini di toko lokal kamu, jangan ragu untuk menjelajahi rasa yang ada dan beri tahu kami rasa mana yang menjadi favorit kamu. 
 
BonCabe
 
Sebagian besar orang Indonesia sangat suka dengan makanan pedas, dan BonCabe sangat memenuhi kebutuhan kita untuk mendapatkan tingkat kepedasan yang pas untuk semua makanan kita. BonCabe memiliki beberapa tingkat kepedasan, dimulai dari level 2 hingga 30. 
 
Keterangan: Foto Boncabe dengan kemasan yang berbeda dan tingkat kepedasan yang berbeda. (Local Guide @AngieYC)
Mengingat saya sekarang tinggal di luar negeri, saya selalu membawa BonCabe kemanapun saya pergi, dan ini sangat penting untuk saya. Cabai bubuk ini tidak hanya menambah kepedasan tetapi juga rasa. Saya sangat suka menaburkannya kedalam sup dan ini sangat cocok dinikmati di musim dingin. Saya juga sedang melatih beberapa teman saya yang tidak suka makanan pedas dengan BonCabe, mulai dari level paling rendah dan saya naikkan secara bertahap. 
 
Saya telah membagikan kedua makanan tersebut, Indomie dan BonCabe kepada banyak teman internasional saya dan mereka sangat menyukainya! Ini adalah cara favorit saya untuk memperkenalkan negara saya kepada semua orang. Melalui cita rasa Indonesia.

696834,"Lokasi favorit saya di Kota Lyon, Perancis",226,54.0,"
Keterangan: Foto Google Moderator @AngieYC berdiri di jembatan diatas Sungai Rhone di Kota Lyon, Perancis. (Local Guide @AngieYC)
Musim panas lalu, saya berkesempatan untuk melakukan perjalanan ke Perancis untuk pertama kalinya dan saya mengunjungi Kota Lyon. Kalian mungkin bertanya-tanya kenapa saya ke Kota Lyon dan bukan Paris, mengingat ini merupakan pertama kalinya saya ke Perancis? Alasan utamanya adalah karena saya menghadiri pernikahan teman baik saya disana. Walaupun Lyon bukanlah kota yang besar, saya jatuh cinta dengan arsitektur dan tentunya makanan disana. 
 
Dalam post ini saya akan berbagi dengan kalian lokasi favorit saya di Kota Lyon yang layak masuk “bucket list” kalian. 
 
1. Notre-Dame de Fourvière Basilica
 
Keterangan: Foto bagian depan dari Notre-Dame de Fourvière Basilica memperlihatkan beberapa kolom tinggi, dua menara lonceng dan satu patung orang suci di pintu masuknya. (Local Guide @AngieYC)
 Notre-Dame de Fourvière Basilica berada di peringkat satu dalam daftar tempat yang harus dikunjungi di Kota Lyon. Lokasinya berada di bukit, namun ada beberapa cara untuk mencapainya. Kamu bisa berjalan, namun cukup menantang karena jalannya yang cukup menanjak, atau dengan menggunakan funicular.
 
Saat saya sampai di basilica, arsitekturnya sangat luar biasa. Sangat indah dan unik untuk saya. Sebagai bonus, karena kita berada diatas bukit, saya bisa menikmati pemandangan yang sangat memanjakan mata. 
 
2. Des Jacobins Fountain
 
Keterangan: Foto Google Moderator @AngieYC bersandar ke Des Jacobins Fountain, yang didekorasi dengan berbagai jenis patung. (Local Guide @AngieYC)
Saya tidak sengaja menemukan air mancur ini saat sedang berjalan santai di sekitar kota. Di sekitarnya, terdapat beberapa bangku yang dijadikan tempat duduk untuk bersantai, dan melihat sekitar. Itulah yang saya lakukan juga, saya duduk sambil melihat apa yang dilakukan orang lokal di sekitar saya. Apakah kamu pernah melakukan hal ini saat melakukan perjalanan keluar negeri?
 
3. Place Bellecour
 
Keterangan: Foto google Moderator @AngieYC berdiri di tengah alun-alun Place Bellecour. (Local Guide @AngieYC)
Place Bellecour adalah salah satu alun-alun terbuka terbesar di Eropa dan alun-alun terbesar ketiga di Perancis. Tempat ini dikelilingi oleh banyak bangunan indah dan adalah tempat terbaik jika kamu ingin melakukan jalan pagi atau sore. 
 
4. Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse
 
Keterangan: Foto mural koki Perancis Paul Bocuse di sebuah gedung. (Local Guide @AngieYC)
Jika kamu melihat mural koki Perancis Paul Bocuse, saat kamu berada di Lyon, berjalanlah ke seberang dan kamu berada di tempat yang tepat! Halles de Lyon Paul Bocuse adalah food hall yang sangat terkenal dan surga bagi para pecinta makanan. Di dalam, kamu dapat menemukan hampir semua jenis makanan yang dapat kamu pikirkan, dari keju, daging, seafood hingga yang manis-manis dan minuman.
 
Karena saya sudah melakukan riset sebelum mengunjungi Kota Lyon dan sudah lama ngidam makan oysters, saya sudah memiliki misi. Saya langsung menuju area seafood dan menikmati sepiring oysters terbaik yang pernah saya coba. 
 
Keterangan: Foto sepiring oyster diatas es dengan lemon disampingnya dan sepotong mentega di tengahnya. (Local Guide @AngieYC)

Every Friday, Google Moderators highlight the best posts they found to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. These are posts detailing past experiences that we hope will serve as entertainment and inspiration for your future bucket list. This week, a river trail in New Zealand, an Indonesian snack, and more.
 
Caption: A photo of the Waikato River surrounded by grass-covered hills and a flock of birds flying over it. (Local Guide @OliverLeeKIWI)@LilyanaZ: I have been yearning to go outside in nature, so @OliverLeeKIWI's post “Waikato River Trail” was a refreshing sight for my sore eyes. In it, you will be able to enjoy breathtaking shots from the beautiful New Zealand and Waikato River trail. Oliver tells us about his trip there and the many activities he did with his family among the greenery of the trail. Make sure you check out the comments under his post for more pictures and a quick disclaimer: don’t take photos while riding a bike.
 
Caption: A photo of a sunset over the Minkan Peace Resort in Yaoundé, Cameroon. (Local Guide @Adambita237)
@Bobiisha: This week, I loved the colors in @Adambita237's post, “Minkan Peace resort.” He tells us about his visit to Minkan Peace Resort, a restaurant in Yaoundé, Cameroon, which looks like a sanctuary of serenity. Apart from enjoying a sunset walk along the stone paths that line the lakes and private bungalows, you can also taste delicious freshwater fish, freshly caught from the lakes. It definitely sounds like a bucket list-worthy spot. 
 
Caption: A photo of weci, a traditional Indonesian fried-dough snack, with sauce and a green chili on top. (Local Guides @iorikun301)
@AngieYC: I have been learning a lot about traditional Indonesian food from @iorikun301. In his detailed posts, he introduces a snack, tells us how to make it and where we can find it, and shares his opinion about it. One of his posts, called “Weci,” showcases a fried-dough snack with vegetables and different toppings. I find it interesting how weci is so similar to traditional snacks from other cities, yet it has some regional differences. I look forward to reading more posts from this Local Guide with some larger photos because those snacks are mouthwatering!
 
Caption: A photo of the entrance to the Ino Tensho Grand Shrine in Fukuoka, taken in summer. (Local Guide @yamamo_cchi)
@Ivi_Ge: As a lover of Japanese culture, this week, I want to highlight @yamamo_cchi's post,  “#monthlytopic The four seasons at a shrine called Ise in Kyushu/九州の伊勢と呼ばれる神社の四季.” Shinto shrines are one of the places that almost every visitor to Japan goes to at least once. You will find them just about anywhere, and, in @yamamo_cchi's post, we see the beautiful Ino Tensho Grand Shrine among the trees in Hisayama, Fukuoka Prefecture. If you are curious to learn more about the shrine and the way it looks during the different seasons, head to this post.

To help you more easily connect with Local Guides in your local area or places around the world, we’ve created Favorite Locations on Connect. The Favorite Locations feature allows you to follow up to three locations and discover posts with those tagged locations.
 
You can add your top three locations in Settings or by visiting the Favorite Locations page on Connect. To see posts from your favorite cities, make sure to include the city, state, and country in the location field to search for it.
 
Once you’ve added the locations you’d like to follow, you’ll find posts with those tagged areas on the Favorite Locations page. In order for a post to show up in the feed, authors must tag the location in the Add a Location field of their draft. Please note that this will be the case for all posts tagged with locations moving forward, but it will not automatically update old posts. So, be sure to always tag locations in your posts before you publish from now on in order to enjoy this feature. You can also go back and update old posts with locations so they will appear in the Favorite Locations feed.
 
We hope this new feature will help you more easily discover posts in the places you care about most, no matter where you are right now.

696834,How do I mark comments as solutions?,347,66.0,"
If you asked a question on Connect by creating a new post, you have the ability to choose a comment as the solution by clicking Accept as Solution. The purpose of this feature is to help Local Guides find answers when searching within the community.
 
Posts with an accepted solution have a green check mark next to them.
 
Caption: A screenshot of four posts on Connect that have accepted solutions.
Should I have an accepted solution for all my posts?
All original or new posts created on Connect can utilize the solution feature. However, depending on the purpose of your original post and the question asked, it is not necessary for all posts to have a solution.
 
If your question is broad and does not require a definite answer (for example: posts soliciting suggestions, comments, and thoughts), you do not have to accept any replies as a solution. 
 
Some examples where a solution is not required:

Where to dine with a view in Tokyo?
What does this sculpture mean to you?
Question for Guides living in small towns

Of course, many posts on Connect do not ask a question at all. Your posts sharing your experiences or interests also do not need an accepted solution. 
 
How do I accept a comment as a solution?
When someone provides you with an accurate answer, you can mark the comment by clicking on the three dot symbol below their post and clicking Accept as Solution.
 
Caption: A screenshot that shows the menu that appears when you click the three dots at the bottom of a comment with “Accept as Solution” highlighted.
When the reply is accepted as a solution, you can see a green check mark on the top right corner and the world “Solution” below the Local Guide’s profile picture in the comment.
 
Caption: A screenshot that shows how a post appears on Connect when it was been marked an accepted solution.
What’s the easiest way to find the solution in the thread?
When a post has an accepted solution, you’ll see a green Go to Solution button at the end of the post. When you click on that button, you’ll be directed to the solution. Or you can easily spot the solution which is pinned as the first comment. 
 
Caption: A screenshot of a Connect post with the green “Go to solution” button that directs you to the solution of the problem.
Who can accept a solution on a post?
The author of the post, Google Moderators, and Connect Moderators have the ability to accept solutions on a post.
 
Who can remove an accepted solutions?
Solutions that appear irrelevant or inaccurate may be unmarked for the benefit of all Local Guides by Google Moderators, Connect Moderators, or the author of the post. Only they have the ability to reverse the status of an accepted solution. A moderator will let you know whenever they remove a solution.
 
How do I unmark a solution?
If you would like to unmark the solution from your post, click on the three dots below the reply and select Not the Solution. 
 
Caption: A screenshot that shows the menu that appears when you click the three dots at the bottom of a comment with “Not the Solution” highlighted.
Can I mark my own reply as a solution?
We do not encourage you to mark your own replies as a solution unless you have proof to back it up. For example, by sharing the link to a post where a similar question with an accepted solution was asked on Connect or an external URL where the answer to your question can be found, like the Local Guides website or the Help Center. 
 
Posts that have irrelevant accepted solutions may be unmarked for the benefit of all Local Guides by Google Moderators or Connect Moderators who have the ability to reverse the status of an accepted solution.
 
Before posting your question or issue on Connect, be sure to search the community as the same question may have already been asked and answered.

Every Friday, Googlers round up some of the best posts they came across during the week to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. This week, Warsaw, Waiheke Island, and more.
 
@AngieYC: “Taman Monumen Bung Hatta: Sebuah Penghormatan Untuk Bapak Bangsa” by @ibadahmimpi is an interesting post for foreigners and a helpful history refresher for Indonesian people. In this post, @ibadahmimpi tell us about a great park in Bukit Tinggi that we can visit. He also includes a great overview about the history we can find inside the park and the story of the long struggle experienced by the Indonesian nation.

@MortenSI: So many great stories have been shared in the past week, but I kept revisiting “Yellowstone National Park, USA” by Local Guide @Noimacki. He rented an RV and went around Yellowstone National Park for four days, seeing beautiful animals, roaring waterfalls, and gorgeous views along the way. He even shared a link to the route he took along with stops within the park, which I find very helpful for others who are planning to go, but don’t know where to start. This post made me want to start planning my very own trip to Yellowstone National Park, and if you are thinking about it too, I strongly suggest you have a look at it.

@MoniV: This week was full of amazing content, but the one that really stood out to me was @christophesubilia's post “Discover Warsaw : between historical tourism and fun.” Right now, I have a small travelling bucket list and, to be honest, I would like to visit Warsaw once again. When I was a teenager, I went to Poland and visited the concentration camps. While it was an enriching experience, I didn’t experience all the beauty and fun that Poland has to offer. @christophesubilia's post is very entertaining and helpful if you are planning a trip there. It's full of really cool tips, which I will definitely use when I visit Warsaw once again.

@KatyaL: The post that I enjoyed reading the most this week is written by @LuigiZ and is about the incredible Waiheke Island—one of the biggest islands in the gulf of New Zealand. “A peaceful day on Waiheke Island” inspired me to visit it one day thanks to the beautiful nature photos and the thoughtful descriptions. I’m also a wine lover, so that’s another great reason for me to go there! It looks like a peaceful and serene place to explore solo or go with the whole family. I would definitely not miss the chance to take a tour around the island!

 What I love about being a Local Guide: One of my favorite things to do is travel and, as a foodie, I love to try foods from different places because I believe food brings people closer together. Being a Local Guide gives me a chance to share my passion for food with the other Local Guides around the world.

 My favorite thing to explore: I love exploring places to eat, especially places recommended by the locals. Since I can’t take food as a souvenir, I always take a picture of my plate as a memory.

 Fun fact about me: I don’t like the sun, but I love the beach. I really like the ambiance and how I can just sit back and relax with fresh, cold coconut juice on the side. I come from an island country that has a lot of beautiful beaches, so I can’t say no to one! I just have to hide under an umbrella.

696834,Makanan Paling Terkenal di Indonesia - Nasi Goreng dan Bakso,185,148.0,"
Keterangan: Foto Semangkok Bakso Didampingi dengan Mie Kuning dan Bayam. (Local Guides @AngieYC)
Nasi goreng dan bakso adalah dua makanan khas Indonesia yang sangat terkenal, dimana keduanya memiliki pengaruh dari akar kuliner dari Tionghua. Indonesia merupakan negara yang memilik lebih dari tiga ratus etnisitas. Terdapat berbagai variasi pada kedua makanan ini tergantung dari daerah asal dan bumbu khas daerah tersebut. Keduanya sangat mudah ditemukan dimana saja, dari pedagang kaki lima hingga restoran dan sangat populer di kalangan masyarakat Indonesia serta para turis yang berkunjung. 
 
Saya sendiri lahir di kota Medan, Sumatera Utara, yang dimana orang lokalnya pecinta makanan gurih dan pedas. Saya sudah pernah mencoba berbagai variasi Nasi Goreng dan Bakso dari beberapa area yang berbeda. Berikut adalah jenis Nasi Goreng dan Bakso kesukaan saya serta tempat untuk menyantapnya.
 
1. Nasi Goreng

Masyarakat Indonesia saya yakin dapat menyantap makanan yang satu ini untuk sarapan pagi, makan siang hingga malam. Tentunya dengan bahan dasar utama yaitu nasi, dengan tambahan topping yang disesuaikan dengan selera masing-masing pribadi.
 
Keterangan: Foto Sepiring Nasi Goreng dengan Sate Ayam, Ayam Suwir serta Kerupuk Udang.  (Local Guides @AngieYC)
Saya sudah mencoba berbagai jenis nasi goreng dari yang klasik, belacan, teri, sampai rica-rica khas Manado. Salah satu restoran favorit saya untuk memesan nasi goreng adalah tesate karena disana nasi gorengnya porsinya cukup besar dan lengkap berbagi topping dari sate, ayam suwir hingga kerupuk. 
 
Nasi Goreng merupakan salah satu menu yang sering saya buat sendiri di rumah, dengan topping sederhana yaitu telur, sayuran, daging ayam atau udang dan yang tidak boleh ketinggalan yaitu acar.
 
2. Bakso

Mayoritas kuliner yang satu ini berbahan dasar daging sapi dan tepung tapioka untuk membuat baksonya lebih kenyal. Selalu ditemani dengan kuah kaldu sapi yang aromatik serta mie kuning atau bihun. Namun, ada juga bakso yang terbuat dari daging ayam, ikan bahkan udang.
 
Keterangan: Foto Semangkok Bakso Sapi disertai Bihun, Daging Sapi Iris dan Daun Ketumbar (Local Guides @AngieYC)Seperti yang kita tahu saat ini bakso semakin hari semakin banyak variasinya. Beberapa versi tradisional yang cukup populer seperti Bakso Malang yang berasal dari Kota Malang, kuahnya tidak terlalu kuat dengan berbagai topping gorengan, ada juga bakso urat, bakso gepeng, dan lain-lain. Sekarang, kamu dapat menemukan bakso keju, bakso isi cabe, bakso raksasa dan masih banyak lagi variasi lainnya. 
 
Tipe bakso favorit saya adalah dari bakso aan. Bakso ini adalah variasi dari kampung halaman saya di Medan. Baksonya sangat kenyal dan terasa daging sapinya, daging irisnya juga sangat lembut. Biasanya kita dapat memilih antara mie atau bihun untuk menemani bakso kita dan pilihan saya selalu bihun.

696834,"Friday Favorites: a day trip to Amritsar, Laguna Esmeralda, and more",167,31.0,"
Every Friday, Googlers round up some of the best posts they came across during the week to celebrate the amazing discoveries Local Guides like you are sharing on Connect. This week, a day trip to Amritsar, Laguna Esmeralda, and more. 
@KlaudiyaG: I don’t know about you, but when I think about Bali, the first thing that pops in my head is the word “paradise.” With its amazing beaches and epic waterfalls, it’s basically a feast for the body, mind, and spirit. There is nothing quite like it. @dian_9395 reminded me of this in his amazing post titled, “5 Best Places to Visit in Bali, Indonesia.” The post might just motivate you to book a one way ticket to Bali straight away. I surely pondered for a moment!

@AngieYC: This post written by @br14n titled, “When The General Managers Get Down To The River” really inspires me to take care of the environment, starting with my own surroundings. Why this is a great post? Well, because it shows that we can all encourage others to step in and make a difference in our communities. Dozen of hotel managers in Batu, East Java, Indonesia gathered to remove litter and plant trees in their area. I hope this type of movement can increase more awareness about environmental issues that are affecting the whole world.

@InaS: Have you ever taken an amazing one day trip? Based on his recent post  “One Day Trip from Delhi to Amritsar on 70th Republic Day of India,” Local Guide @gowthamselvam definitely has!  He described in great detail what it was like to spend a day exploring Amritsar with his friend. Despite the crowds, they were able to see some great sights, enjoy delicious food, and watch exciting performances on this special day. His story might just inspire you grab a friend and explore a new place!

@KatyaL: The post “Historias de Senderismo - Laguna Esmeralda” written by @FaridTDF is one of the best posts I’ve read this week. The place is really inspiring for a visit and the post is very well written and detailed. The Laguna Esmeralda is a great place to go hiking. The forests of Ñires and Lenga and the panorama of Ushuaia Mountain look absolutely amazing! The emerald colors of the river are extraordinary and beautiful. For me, sharing the beauty of the world with others is one of the best things about being a Local Guide—and Farid definitely does that in this post.

696834,3 must-try restaurants in Singapore,212,97.0,"

I got the chance to visit Singapore two weeks ago. I made a stop there for a few days while on my way to my hometown, Jakarta. I had always known Singapore is a very diverse city in terms of cuisine, so I thought that it would make for the perfect food crawl for a foodie like me.
 
Here are the three best restaurants I went to.
 
1. Thye Hong Eateries Pte. Ltd
Do you like the combination of noodles and seafood? If your answer is yes, then the prawn Hokkien mee is a must-try for you. This is a classic meal, which has become a signature dish of Singapore. I could find it everywhere in the city, but in my opinion the best place to try it was at the Thye Hong Eateries Pte. Ltd. restaurant.

The prawn Hokkien mee is full of flavor. It’s made of yellow and rice noodles, rich seafood stock, and prawns.
 
2. Kam’s Roast
Even though this is a one Michelin star restaurant, I didn’t have high expectations when I first heard about it. The reason is that the Kam’s Roast’s specialty is roasted duck, a dish so common in Asia.
 
When we were seated in the restaurant, we received an order card to fill in and give to the waiter. First we ordered a jellyfish—a cold appetizer, also popular in my area. This dish was lightly seasoned with vinegar, soy sauce, sesame oil, and sesame seeds. It felt crunchy while I was chewing it, and that was very refreshing.

Then the star of the evening came out—the special roasted duck. When I saw the sauce underneath the duck, I thought it would make the duck soggy. I couldn’t be more wrong! The duck skin was crispy, the meat was very tender, and the sauce simply completed the whole experience.

The Haidilao Hot Pot @ 313 restaurant impressed me the most because of its service. When we were seated, the staff welcomed us with hot towels, aprons (so we didn’t stain our clothes), hair ties for the women, and ziplock bags for our phones in case we spilled the soup.
 
There was a sauce and appetizer bar where we could mix and match the sauces and enjoy a free appetizer while waiting for our order to arrive.
 
It turned out that this restaurant doesn’t play around when it came to broth selections. We could choose to have a one, two, three, or four-section hot pot with broth of any flavor we wanted. I chose a four-section hot pot with classic chicken broth, pork broth, mala broth, and sour soup broth. There was a great variety of toppings to choose from—anything from meat and fish to vegetables and tofu.

One of the signature things to order at the Haidilao Hot Pot @ 313 was the dancing noodle. There would be a short performance by the noodle maker, dancing around with the noodles among the customers. After the performance, he would cut and put the noodles in your hot pot.

This usually is a pretty packed restaurant and you’ll likely have to wait for a table if you didn’t make a reservation beforehand. But if you think you’d be bored while waiting here, think again. There are free snacks and drinks provided in the waiting area, free manicures, and a kids’ playroom.

696834,Seperti apa rasanya merayakan Hari Kemerdekaan Indonesia di luar negeri,93,53.0,"
Saya seorang warga negara Indonesia, berasal dari kota Medan. Namun, saya telah tinggal di Bulgaria selama hampir dua tahun. Baru-baru ini, saya menerima undangan dari Kedutaan Besar Republik Indonesia untuk merayakan Hari Kemerdekaan Republik Indonesia di Bulgaria. Saya sangat senang diundang untuk menghadiri acara ini karena kamu dapat merasakan semangat nasionalisme dari masyarakat Indonesia di sini di Bulgaria. Ditambah, masakan Indonesia tiada duanya.
 
Perayaan kemerdekaan Republik Indonesia ke-73, diadakan di Sofia, Bulgaria dan dihadiri oleh warga negara Indonesia yang saat ini tinggal di Bulgaria, Albania dan Makedonia.
 
Di bawah ini adalah beberapa momen menarik yang kami ikuti untuk merayakan hari kemerdekaan Republik Indonesia tahun ini.
 
 1. Upacara Pengibaran Bendera
Acara dimulai dengan melakukan upacara resmi, dimulai dari pembukaan oleh Duta Besar Republik Indonesia untuk Bulgaria H.E. Sri Astari Rasjid, dilanjutkan dengan pengibaran Sang Saka Merah Putih.

2. Makan Pagi Khas Indonesia
Tidak lengkap rasanya jika dalam merayakan hari bahagia tanpa menyantap sarapan khas Indonesia. Untuk hidangan sarapan kali ini disiapkan oleh chef Kedutaan Republik Indonesia. Menu kali ini terdiri dari nasi kuning yang dilengkapi berbagai macam lauk dari ayam goreng, urap, telur balado dan lainnya.
 
Keterangan: Foto nampan berisi berbagai makanan khas Indonesia untuk Perayaan Hari Kemerdekaan Indonesia3. Perlombaan 
Salah satu acara yang tidak boleh terlewatkan saat merayakan hari kemerdekaan Indonesia adalah perlombaan khas tujuhbelasan. Satu yang harus ada adalah lomba makan kerupuk. Namun selain itu ada juga lomba lain yang dilakukan seperti tiup gelas dan untuk orang dewasa ada permainan volley.
 
 Keterangan: Foto anak-anak yang berpartisipasi dalam lomba makan kerupuk.  Kerupuk digantung pada seutas tali dan anak-anak mencoba memakannya tanpa menggunakan tangan.
Terlepas dari jauhnya saya dari Tanah air, saya sangat senang dapat merayakan hari bersejarah ini bersama sesama Masyarakat Indonesia tahun ini.
